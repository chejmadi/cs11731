the animal jumps , it &apos;s got it breitet his wings , it &apos;s vibriert that , but it can &apos;t be really abheben , because the fly is trapped between two glasscheiben .
for a smart creature , as our fly , this rule is not in stone , but changing during the animal of experience .
by many of these experiments , we were able to be able to shrink the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the computerwissenschaft and artificial intelligence , how you could do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved any single example of how smart behavior is really what the physical behavior is affecting in living matter .

so , a long time , brief : they came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most most of the time , the most of the time , the good thing , how did the good and the bad ?
some articles even went to say that skelettmuskelgewebe is to be gegen against cancer , and beyond it , not only to attack that metastases are spread in skeletal muscle .

this is a very widespread idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
after that , i left my translator .
she was the girl , which was the other team for her team .
and then i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia that had a 11 son to 11 son .

but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon , or is it something that &apos;s going to be based on the planet ?
and this deep gründende , underlying note , is that science is the science of life , as we know it .
okay , we say , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
and you see , uganda absinkt and zimbabwe absinkt , had russia in a percent .
they find the highest hiv in the world in the world , and yet , they find them in senegal , here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at this one here .
it might be something that is something else , which is more likely to engage the transmission .
we know that about 25,000 billion people have ever lived .
it wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a bigger divergence in a shorter interval than in germany .
it &apos;s also with institutions .
you have to be just to eat . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end three questions about the future billion , a year ago , when the united states is going to be a number of a number of a number of economy in china .
no , we &apos;re probably going to be durchhalten , regardless of the great schuldenlast that we have learned , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work and other parts of our historical lives .
niall , thank you .
there are lots of species of spider .
spider silk is almost entirely composed of protein .
the fibers , which can make a single spider , are pretty diverse .
also , there &apos;s a great potential because of its capacity to the raketenabwehr .
what i want to do is not to be the meerjungfrauparade , so you may be so so often , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
this sounds in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the most mitwirkenden unterdurchschnittlich have been a lot of contributed .
the first thing happens when you &apos;re a problem with a problem that the first goal of institution immediately is also going to the beetle .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there &apos;s people in the states , the krampfhaft attempt to figure out whether or not be journalists or not .
it was created by making their kommunikationsmuster , using their werkzeuge , who are analysierte , and certainly , the same time , the same time , the same time the same work for the most people in the last week .
you &apos;ve got kleie , which is probably for us , the most part part of the bread is , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just filled with fibers , because it &apos;s just made of fibers .
everything is on its place . first level .
we call it &quot; gare . &quot;
but let &apos;s take the different steps , under the gesichtspunkt of the possible connections to a deeper plane -- my quest to be bent to the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , they go back to the way that they &apos;re alive and character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of treber .
it will become a kind of refrain , while we &apos;re going to work through these talk .
it takes very long , very long , and i work at the time , i work on a piece that &apos;s 180 , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;ll put my hair .
it &apos;s going to come from brian mcwhorter , who is an extraordinary artist .
so , you have a little vorgeschmack of the piece .
what we did -- betty betty , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food : a bowl of rohem broccoli , and a bowl of leckeren goldfisch-kräcker .
i mean , last , in the end , when we look at babies , they &apos;re really useless .
and our babies and children are much more dependent on us than the babies of any other species .
the befund is bringing them to change the hypothesis .
now there &apos;s two things that really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s how .
our consciousness think about this thing , extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be like dark .
&quot; babies and little kids are like the research and the entwicklungsabteilung of the human species , &quot; the psychologin alison alison gopnik , and their research is like the spielens of the spielens of the mind of information and making decisions .
if i just take you for a little bit of a little demonstration , you could take a little bit of a little demonstration to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
and then you repeated this process , and over again , you get over and over again , the etwas of this -- in this case , i want to go out , like i , walk .
what we really wanted to do was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do anything .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes like it &apos;s going to be .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve made it done .
some of the studios are already using our software to do that , and we &apos;re going to get a few of our stuntmännern in some big filmproduktionen .
we thought he just thought it was the balance .
here you learn to go to the töpfchen -- how most of you will know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m confident that art and creativity are all sorts of information .
if you ever get ever lonely , they write a new york times , you get hundreds of emails , and most of the things that i &apos;ve done today , and most of the time i &apos;ve done today , i &apos;m going to have a berichtet .
some stories are just enjoying it , and yet it &apos;s so basic .
it versank . no one bought ever bought .
there &apos;s one frontier that we don &apos;t want to do . so what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want a new , empty document in the word -- that could be a new thing that could possibly be !
i think it &apos;s actually two microsofts .
the other products have been supported by microsoft , rather than open standard , rather than apples firmeneigenen .
and genause , if somebody writes a hassbrief writes -- what happens -- i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to me . &quot;
but when i looked at the mächtigeren technologies , nanotechnology , gentechnologie and others , in the course of the most endangered technologies , i made very big worried about the missbrauchspotenzial .
and to limit the risk of this new things , we ultimately have to end the ability of individuals that are going to be able to make the access to the access to the access .
i think the challenge we face -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is , we &apos;re going to use this bildungsmaterialien with the background that are going to use us out of this machine ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , for example , you have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last few of the last few of the last few of the last few , it &apos;s got to be 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s right for us .
and if you use the concept of the konzept , you can use a much more mächtigere than the marketplace -- the bottom of the marketplace -- they use the feedback .
12 years ago , started to me and i &apos;m making my research in this direction .
wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice cream under the surface .
so they &apos;re a langsamere species .
it &apos;s actually much energy for biology in this cave , that there &apos;s actually a big number of mass .
we can see them .
we &apos;ve noticed a few years ago that there are many of many traits that are used by people and other organisms as being used as a habitat .
whenever you have a goal , to follow their verwirklichung , to be very steps , they &apos;re going to be a sense of mühen .
and so it &apos;s also archimedes , the great greek mathematicians .
and they &apos;ve got to get it over and it was suffered under any starkem schimmelbefall .
that means before we start to digitize the archimdes , we had to take the book .
and this is what looks like .
but by the way that the electrons of light flies , they give it to make it .
this was a bad idea , because philipp of the satellite had had a son called alexander of the big , and they lost the battle of chaironeia .
because in the moment , they have a schränken of their data with urheberrechtsbeschränkungen and so on .
the original owners of the bottle , one of most of the most enthusiastischen weinliebhaber of the eighteenth century .
i asked myself : 160 dollars for this ?
she has four balconies .
a wiederkehrendes scheme is that many of these things from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a freihändig , klopapier-freie toilet .
there was a object that i couldn &apos;t get into the fingers , and that was the 1947er cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call them my taste of a banausens -- so it &apos;s not necessarily not necessarily that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i was not the only one there .
so the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid was sold for 330.000 dollars .
the really interesting thing about virtuality is that you can measure them .
well , i could create a game with the name of the name , by just to get a million pies or a thousand pies .
if there are real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality is that .
and i want to tell you a quick story , so i was there a video game called everquest .
it &apos;s about how to develop social engagement , by the psychological and neurological insights that we get when we &apos;re going to see people .
it &apos;s a kind of versteinerter zahnbelag , the offiziell of the formally as an zahnstein .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
there &apos;s been a million people in america , 49 million people and almost 16.7 million children .
and their farms are big .
it &apos;s the 30th anniversary of genverändertem grain , and the big gulp , von fruktosehaltigem , hochkonzentriertem fruktosehaltigem , hochkonzentriertem fruktosehaltigem , the landwirtschaftskrise , the landwirtschaftskrise of the way we are in agriculture and the way we &apos;re international .
this is a bauhelm that i received two years ago , and that was at one of the greatest projects i was in and i was also involved in the other .
but i &apos;m going to walk on the start of the process , three and three .
if we are so good in what we do , we should not be able to create a architectural manifestation of creating the reibungslos and projektseitigen ?
the architectural evidence was , ehlich , simpel .
and this is the actual lohn of the effort .
the second technology we were seeing , we use things that you know about the seitenbühnen of a opera .
here &apos;s the ebenerdige configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how you collects stories , in a little bit more .
one of these projects is about a year old .
these are the pictures that are automatically going to automatically .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera to get the neck .
you can see a timeline that tells you the very exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s bartenwal . well , on .
a 28-jähriger inhaber inhaber .
a 80-jähriger , umherziehender farmer .
what if you only found the truth , what would you do next to your life ?
&quot; money deserve and a business open , &quot; was the indian indian straßenarbeiter .
during the box he said he wanted to be his wanting to have a etwa überlebenschance .
don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has to be used .
with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in steno , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if it means that means .
you don &apos;t really appreciate that .
if someone had seen a black board of 1973 , the slang would have been a little different from the time , &quot; love &quot; -- but he would have understood what was standing .
i &apos;m about the zeitlimit , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can see my work next week at night , and also in the bitforms gallerie in chelsea .
afghanistan don &apos;t care for global threat for global safety .
and the same thing for the troops .
instead , there was a litanei of erstaunlichem optimism .
diplomats don &apos;t fall in botschaftsgeländen .
and then we need to understand that the secret of the fact that we were in bosnia and in kosovo , the secret to our success in our humility , in the most basic part of our own .
rory , it &apos;s just recently to end .
so here &apos;s two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you what it looks like .
there are also teststreifen , the eingetaucht , but if you betrachen these teststreifen , that &apos;s going to use a different kind of urinanalyse .
the selektionsproblem . this is a difficult problem of reasons that i won &apos;t be erleutern .
there &apos;s another , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to be valuable information about a very bad physical model .
so , i think it has the minimal kost that we can probably do to make things .
and we decided that we don &apos;t think about it in terms of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that means &quot; &quot; what &apos;s the &quot; matter &quot; ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact with people with people who don &apos;t like themselves .
so we can think of things like the straßenverlauf .
i &apos;m kidding , but just half , if i say you &apos;re going to believe in the hospital , if you &apos;re going to go back to a kind of a fehlenden , without vorherigen , and orthopädische konsultation .
then , the bell is to end up his students .
within a few years , in the late 19th , and early 20th century , the doctor was born , who was trying to provide a diagnosis of stellen .
between the perception of patient and doctors in terms of the south african health care is a real contradiction .
another experience that i was in texas before i went to stanford , i was going to go to the stanford .
the bad news : the exact surprising thing we know is that we know , and you see ? can you do that we can do . &quot;
i remember so many enormous , ausgehölte , arguments that i &apos;m going to be in this ritual .
some call us entlarver , a rather unfreundliche .
in this case , we have the peak .
so , for you , there &apos;s , &quot; then , a miracle !
and there was no way to 1655 .
religious ikonographie .
and harder is , the dead is to move forward .
my friend simon singh , a teilchenphysiker , nunmehr , nunmehr , wrote the book &quot; the big bang &quot; big bang &quot;
and now you open your eyes .
you can open it completely completely open , and it &apos;s wasserundurchlässig .
but it has to think about this , and i think , that these guys , most of the ones , what they do for living .
everybody thought that was impossible .
you can create lots of change . you can make streets .
and that &apos;s something that people want to know .
you don &apos;t need everybody .
and hugo chavez has unzufriedene arbeiter- and middle eastern in venezuela . he has just been doing it .
and so it goes on and it goes .
they connect people together .
the reason ? the variation of modern medicine uses a 60 years ago .
there &apos;s a catch .
it makes it schneller , even more günstiger , over the 26 times cheaper and 400 times cheaper than our primary health care system .
my experience with the world &apos;s experience of the world &apos;s the world , but quite different .
there are b. the character .
and why does sex leads to babies , and why is the babies in relationships a erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the neocortex .
especially in this description of this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same thing -- especially interesting , that there &apos;s no bedürftigkeit in desire .
this is your dreh- and angelpunkt , that &apos;s biology , the natural instinct .
there &apos;s the desire , that &apos;s what we need to do this study , entdeckerdrang .
you know that there &apos;s a very depressing space that every time has heard each other .
other places in the country had similar rooms .
in a gothischen cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s going to be played in smaller rooms .
so early hip-hop-gruppen , some hip-hop-gruppen , some of the people have zusammengeschnitten .
so i asked myself , ok , this is a model for design , these anpassung that we &apos;re wrong ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s on me !
how do we solve the three of three issues that i want to bring to the language ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m just talking about somebody when i was talking about a talk , and i went to sing .
what &apos;s about life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and there were about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said , &quot; rare , &quot; rare have evolved so much so potent mind with so much of the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he was doing .
i &apos;m not going to talk about the ermordeten of the ermordeten .
but for that , you have to take about 10 minutes and a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i never got in .
harvest ernten , baby-zähne , baby-zähne , baby-zähne , baby-zähne , baby-zähne , baby-zähne , baby-zähne .
with tears , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 : a young woman is präsident sirleaf and tells them , how she and her siblings , their parents died in war .
we go into rural areas and everything we do , what &apos;s happening in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look at 20 years of the room and see that there &apos;s a liberianisches girl , a ghanaisches , nigerianisches girl on this ted .
lg : so you know , are going to happen .
licklider realized , computers can do the necessary to do the necessary to make a difference and making decisions .
each interaction is going to be more sensors , your phone , your phone , your credit , your computer , and we get a lot of data , and we get the opportunity to understand our own human .
these records were human bezugsformate .
by a regular process , what else is going to be a job for 40 months , was a simple job for three people in 40 hours , and all of it &apos;s siege siege .
we should stop looking out to see outside .
for dinner with my wife and the children go home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have time to be mentally stimulated , you want to be able to get a lot of time .
she was a much bigger dog than i thought .
these effects affect us all .
the boom of the national autobahnbaus autobahnbaus gesellte to our problems .
think of fahrradläden , getränkestände .
in the era of katrina , we have more common .
and they all have done that , and if not , you &apos;re going to have to be .
help me to make green new black . help me to make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be a chance to use scratch , to make a interactive map for my mom .
but i &apos;m skeptical that this terminus statement .
in this case , you take a bewegungsblock , you put it on a pile and the pile of blöcken , the behavior of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case , the big thing .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
when kids like these projects like these projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s only the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background , the idea is that cars are art .
i &apos;m going to talk about this .
and i think that this idea that great cars is a soul , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , all of you , you know , a car with the first sight . you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite lieblingsgemälde that really describes our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven wohnungen of wohnungen elizabeth in the malibu house in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we &apos;re going to be a little bit of one day at this day , and we &apos;re going to have trennten the other threads through , and we schmiedeten the concept for the actual nature of true teamarbeit and creativity .
we didn &apos;t get him to boston .
because i just have a little lab , i just have a little lab .
now we have clinical trials in four maus-modellen of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of verkaufs- and marketingpersonal that we can put this forward on the market .
100 billion is the only number that you have to know .
what you need to think about is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was , why the entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to the answer , we have a good theory that can explain this , if this theory is true , and that the theory is going to be the most of the dark energy .
and so it &apos;s going to be even though the universe lasts forever , and radiation and radiation are going to be gewöhnliche and radiation to be verflüchtigen , some of the most efficient fluctuations , even some of the thermal fluctuations .
but we also have the great fluctuations .
it cools down .
it &apos;s a rücksichtslose fact of the universe that you accept and not to ask .
i never had a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to tell you about all of you , like me , say , to the africans and the poor people fighting with your dreams .
what i &apos;m moving in my real world was just to be just documenting my little device in digital world , and eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my fahrradhelm , and put it a little bit of schieff , which was the projektor good .
the camera is not just not only just my movements , but it &apos;s also able to understand what things i &apos;m in my hand .
and why just comuter ? we can just play with a papieren .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is to learn about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to park the earth &apos;s park in rio , june june .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep below the earth to build such a temporary .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year we have this awful erdrutsche .
we &apos;re under the average in terms of the population in the city .
a city of the future is a city that anybody can make any of these great community , which are cities .
the best answer is to try to try to reconstruct a darwinian entstehungsgeschichte of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is , they &apos;re beautiful , so they &apos;re making it a kind of gravity so that they give you joy , they just look at them .
and some are too big to use them for butchering for butchering .
our strong response to pictures , to the expression of emotions , to the art of music , to the beauty of music is going to be at us and our offspring , as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see , you can see here as the computer here is looking at the environment , and since you can &apos;t see the vibration , we actually have the driver &apos;s rider , so he can actually see what &apos;s going on .
time can &apos;t see if mark &apos;s going to avoid .
or for blind people , in everyday devices , in the haushalt , in education and in the office .
a subtle konditionierungsprozess had begun to , and the implikation that ordinary people are not voices and i heard them , would be heard that something was wrong with me .
my talk was a catalyst for diskriminierungen , and sexuelle and sexual übergriffe , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , they would be better better because cancer is to cure as a schizophrenia . &quot;
to paraphrasieren chavez , if the social change starts , he can &apos;t be more aufgehalten .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that it &apos;s where we should seek to life , rather than mars , although mars is also a much more nuanced and interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were a whole bunch of contempt .
because it &apos;s the way that the kind of life that there is out there , it has enormous advantages to life on the planet .
there was another object that &apos;s going to be the high aufragende of creatures with creatures and wasserspeiern and nackten -- pretty much gruselige things for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and they may be wondering , and they might be wondering in things that would find people to a new way of doing a new functionality .
the other thing , the humanistisch is an , is that we decided that all the technical gadgets , this whole nerdzeug , and trying to do it as beautiful as possible .
so we called y . so this is another example of the stuff that happens in a room , the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the development of brand , it &apos;s all deeply interconnected .
this is my neffe anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for one afternoon , i had to go back to the back . this was hard .

then they &apos;ll be able to do it .
you need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation , which is in a world where everything is papierlos and in the few of our best talks on a screen .
ultimately , it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if you get a bit more wundert , why it &apos;s interesting to be interesting , then they have to look at the rest of the saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s shared in the area .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
and let me give you one example : in turkey , where i &apos;m interested in , where i &apos;m a very über-sekuläre republic , we had something that i call a etwas , which i call säkularismuspolizei , which is the universities to protect the universities .
now , if i would have the only person that thinks that &apos;s like that , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims as muslims , they were independent , they were independent .
so the european process , the efforts of turkey , the european union , the eu , in turkey , in the turkey of the frommen muslims , while some of the nichtreligiöse nations were .
there &apos;s a very big nose that doesn &apos;t seem to be able to be connected to anything .

mo bros from canada from canada , from the united states , and from england , and i was calling us to us , and they said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year , we had to be lucky to have a 000 promi-botschafter . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , men , to participate , in each age , is so critical and important , and i think , is much more important than the funds we collect .
he could see what his forest happened , his grandfather took him under his breath when he was two years old , and he started to teach him about the forest and the journey of his people .

we gather these physicists in los angeles , to see what they &apos;re building .
a mill .
they slept in this schulstunde .
this is a umwerfende vision .

the price is the displacement of the paradise .
and they moved and rieben and they were going to go and abwandern their arms and abwandern .

we &apos;ve become the russian origins of los angeles by being transformed into electricity .
co2e emissions are äquivalente emissions of all the emissions and particles , and co2 the warming and co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons of nuclear power is about nuclear power , because we know that india and pakistan were able to have covered in urananreicherung atomwaffen in atomenergieanlagen .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the standfläche is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power .
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of parties -- only one or two voices are necessary to durchzubringen global warming , and that &apos;s the saal that it can help .
we &apos;re not going to get out of renewables , not enough .
i was going to worry about the 10 years to me .

that means that your surfaces can make themselves . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was , how we can use these new algorithmic order to express these new order of a column .
what i didn &apos;t know about the time , because we had just seen the outside the outside , the surfaces continues to continue to falteten , within the column , and that was a pretty surprising discovery .
and the process of the zellteilung schreibt writes , the incredible , amazing , amazing , amazing forms of surfaces , amazing , a human being , and you can create them by creating your hand , but you can build them , and they could revolutionize our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture -- lots of shapes here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip is actually ahmt the atembewegung .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think there &apos;s many people here in the room , many of them are in the same position as i .

so i became more or less than anything like &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe , if i make this ants a few apartments , you pull it out . &quot;
this was called &quot; the huf house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly , , when i get five , five or seven weeks , six weeks ; it can &apos;t always be always any of the time .
and i &apos;m going to go around and shaped it into the kampfwagen .
so i was crushing .
it &apos;s a very selfish work , but the best things come in little paketen .

it &apos;s actually very lebenslos , if you look at it , you really don &apos;t really do something .
now , where they &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
we then see the self-assembly of these bodies from öltröpfchen that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black musicians are in these black mud -- these facettenreichen , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin protozellen , &quot; experimentelle of chemicals that are acting as living cells . his work , how do you think of life on earth -- and maybe even elsewhere .
this is a kaulquappen-gehwagen , to take your tadpole on the night .
what &apos;s the -- how did they knew that ? they did it .
but if we were doing that in every -- every fire , we could redefine the emergency .

it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re going to make our research on the world , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal quest of humans , a car .
let me talk about this to be about hydrogen .
this is a huge moeglichkeit energy to create new energy .
if we can see these moegliche future , that &apos;s another one .
you had to survive .

we &apos;ve reached as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence .
and when people started with the people , objects like this far , was that a clue that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer ?
