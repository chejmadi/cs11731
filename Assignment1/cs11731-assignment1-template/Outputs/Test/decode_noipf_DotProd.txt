health -- it &apos;s not a way of the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do . </s>
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could make a call or we could make b . </s>
a has spread and fundamentally , and the risks . </s>
b is , and it &apos;s taking the risks . what do you want to do ? </s>
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot; </s>
the doctor says , a <unk> has this benefits and taking the benefits and taking the benefits and taking the benefits and taking the benefits and taking care of the benefits and taking the benefits and taking the benefits and taking care of the benefits and ethics . </s>
what do you want to do ? </s>
and if you were saying , &quot; if you were to say , doc , what would you do ? &quot; </s>
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not a . &quot; </s>
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; -- that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift from the responsibility of the responsibility of choices -- not in reality -- not in the best constitution of decisions -- not in the best constitution -- to the patient &apos;s shift . </s>
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for people like you and me , if you think about it , no sense of doing no sense because we don &apos;t buy them . </s>
why do we not buy if we can &apos;t buy ? </s>
the answer is , you &apos;re expecting the doctor at the next morning and ask a change in the next morning . </s>
something like our identity is a question of choice as this slide show . </s>
we don &apos;t invent them . </s>
and we invent so often we like to take away . </s>
that means that every day , when you wake up on the morning , you have to decide what kind of person is . </s>
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time that almost everybody was going to be able to get everybody in the <unk> , that almost every one had been able to go and could be so quickly , and then as quickly as they could . </s>
the only true choice was &quot; who &quot; not when , and not what they did . </s>
today , all of you have is simple . </s>
i &apos;m teaching wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less than i was doing . </s>
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re carefully , and they &apos;re not because they are worrying about . </s>
it &apos;s because they are busy with other things , they &apos;re asking themselves , &quot; should i marry , or i don &apos;t know ? should i get married ? </s>
should i marry later ? should i have children , or just career , or just so , &quot; do you make a career . &quot; </s>
they &apos;re all <unk> questions . </s>
and they are going to answer these questions about whether that &apos;s going to be able to do that , i &apos;m going to give you the other tasks and not to get a good job in my class . </s>
and they should do that . this is important to <unk> questions . </s>
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl has been saying , with the one every day of every day of every day , to work every day -- until the <unk> hotel . </s>
there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m going to tell you about , i &apos;m going to tell you about the <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m not going to use it , because i want to use it . </s>
so what it means to do this incredible freedom of choice , and again , we should have a working on work , and again , if we should not work , whether we should be done or not to work or not . </s>
we can play our kids playing football , and we have our conduct to do our own hip , and our blackberry and our laptop probably probably harbors our laptop . </s>
and even though they are all the time , every minute we &apos;ve got our child in the modern <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; should i get this call out of this call . &quot; </s>
should i do to get on this email ? should i write that letter ? &quot; </s>
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , it &apos;s certainly their experience of the child &apos;s her child &apos;s <unk> very different experience than it would have been . </s>
everywhere we look at big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice . </s>
and the world we lived in this way . </s>
so i want to say , there were some choice , but not all of it was a question of choice . </s>
and the world &apos;s life looks like , &quot; look . </s>
and the question is , is the good news or bad news news news ? </s>
the answer is yes . </s>
we know all of what &apos;s really good about it . </s>
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects of effects on people . </s>
it &apos;s a effect , <unk> way . </s>
with so many options that you can choose to be really tough , it &apos;s very hard to decide to do it at all . </s>
i &apos;m going to give you another example of the example of a survey , a study about investing in volunteers . </s>
one of me had a colleague of mine , access access to about <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million , and about 2,000 different kinds of different jobs . </s>
and what she was found was 10 to the employers <unk> , took the participation to two percent . </s>
they provide 50 percent less than if they &apos;re just spending five , why ? </s>
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are available to the choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide that it &apos;s a lot of what you &apos;re supposed to choose on tomorrow . </s>
and then , and then , and then , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never comes from . </s>
and you know , that &apos;s not only means that people would take to eat more food if they don &apos;t have enough money to do it , it means that the decisions that make decisions so hard <unk> so hard their permission to the employers . </s>
by not participation , they &apos;re not going to be u.s. u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> who had been to reproduce . </s>
paralysis is a consequence of a lot of choices . </s>
and i think it looks like this , and i think it looks like this . </s>
you want to get the decision really , really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ? </s>
they don &apos;t want to choose to be a fake , or <unk> the wrong . </s>
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even when we &apos;re going to master the paralysis , and a choice , we end less pleased about the outcome of the choices , when we could have the opportunity to deal with . </s>
and there are several reasons for this . </s>
one of them is the most powerful choice of <unk> in the brain , if you buy a car , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s going on is it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s going on is it &apos;s easy to imagine that you have a choice of choice in the happiness that they had to choice , even though it was a good
more options , the more simple is there at all , the more simple that you make , the typical is necessary for the choices that are . </s>
second , economists call &quot; <unk> . </s>
dan gilbert actually got a big spot in the morning , by telling how the way we compare things about to do things in terms of things . </s>
well , if there &apos;s very many alternative to concerns , it &apos;s just properties of the alternative that makes them less properties of alternative that makes you less happy with the alternative that they chose . </s>
here &apos;s a example . for the sake of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize . </s>
but here &apos;s what you should have . </s>
here &apos;s a couple of a few . </s>
very expensive of gender . </s>
beautiful day . great day . they did it all for themselves . </s>
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; the man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august . </s>
everybody in my <unk> &apos;s path . </s>
i could go straight to my house . &quot; </s>
and he spends two weeks of his thought he &apos;s got the chance to have a great parking lot of parking space . </s>
<unk> <unk> , which we &apos;re using through our choices , even if we &apos;re doing what we &apos;re doing . </s>
and the more choices there is available to the choices of these selection , in the <unk> economy . </s>
here &apos;s another example . </s>
now , this cartoon makes some of the statements . </s>
he makes a message about it and maybe even things like to do things . </s>
but one more important point that he is , always , who is always interested in the same thing , you know , you don &apos;t choose to do other things . </s>
and these other things may have many people are , and it &apos;s going to be less , less potent . </s>
third , <unk> , the expectations . </s>
this has been struck me when i was a crank , i wanted to share my jeans . </s>
i wear the time . </s>
and there was a time in the back of it , just in a way , and they bought them , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and they were often long enough they were doing , they started to <unk> enough . </s>
so , to buy new york , the <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot; </s>
and the construction man said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , easy for a job ? </s>
do you want to buttons or <unk> ? stone or <unk> ? </s>
do you want to be associated with holes ? </s>
if you want to stay down , he blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah and so on . </s>
my pine was down and after i was signed up , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the one was the only way . &quot; </s>
he had no idea what was that was , so i spent a hour that was put on the tin jeans , and that &apos;s the store -- and i &apos;ll tell the truth -- i &apos;ll ever ever have been . </s>
i had better , all these things that we have to have better . </s>
but i felt more . </s>
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain myself . </s>
the reason i was reminded , i felt more felt about all these <unk> , my expectations for a good pair of good for a good job . </s>
i had a very low expectations . i had no expectations expectations than it was in a way . </s>
as they came in a hundred species , a gentleman should have been perfect , perfect , that we should be told . </s>
and what i got was good . it was perfect . </s>
and so i get what i get was to get away from what i was going to do was disappointing to what i was going to do . </s>
the add of possibilities in the lives of the human being increases , inevitably , the expectation of the people have about how to be good . </s>
and this leads to a happiness , even though the results are good . </s>
nobody knows in the world of mind , because if you were it , you know , don &apos;t know what it is . </s>
the truth is more like this . </s>
the reason it was much better than anything worse than anything worse than anything was to make it worse than anything had a pregnant for people . </s>
today , in the world we live -- we &apos;re in figuring out , epidemics of the best citizen -- the best thing for you can hope , is the things that you can ever expect to you about . </s>
they &apos;re never going to be <unk> because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> . </s>
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all came to -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations . </s>
i want to say -- a brand-new <unk> moment -- that i married with a woman married , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful . </s>
i couldn &apos;t have better to do it . i don &apos;t have a <unk> . </s>
but <unk> isn &apos;t always so bad thing . </s>
finally , a consequence of a bad thing is that if there is only one type of a thing that is clear , that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and they &apos;re wondering why who you are dissatisfied , and they &apos;re wondering why you could do it ? </s>
when hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the disappointing is , and they ask why , who is responsible ? </s>
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s . </s>
they could have better . </s>
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse to mistakes . </s>
and so , when people make decisions , and also when they are the choices of choices , they feel more about it , they feel more about themselves . </s>
clinical generation in the industrial world in the world . </s>
i think a <unk> -- not the only but a <unk> <unk> <unk> to this explosion , and also , suicide <unk> <unk> , and then suicide <unk> that people have experienced that are because their fuel be so high . and then they have to blame these experiences . </s>
and so that &apos;s what the <unk> that we &apos;re going to do is objective , and we feel bad . </s>
so let me remind you . </s>
this is the official <unk> that we all think about is unsustainable , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true
there is no question that is better than not , but it &apos;s not going to be more choices than something that &apos;s better than anything . </s>
there is a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is . </s>
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed that we &apos;ve missed that we &apos;re going to have a long time . </s>
now , as a writer , i &apos;m almost ready -- as a lush question , the thing that makes all these choices , the thing that makes all these choices in the industrialized societies is the materials . </s>
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about from many of you who are whose problems not to be the big choices . </s>
your problem is that they have a little bit . </s>
so the things i talk about , is a very simple issue of modern , rich societies , western societies . </s>
and what is so frustrating and annoying is steve <unk> , tell them how to tell them how to do this expensive , and it &apos;s hard to help the car seats . </s>
what i tell you about is that these expensive expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them . </s>
they even hurt . </s>
they &apos;re worried about it . </s>
if something of what the people of society is making decisions to the societies in which people would have that , wouldn &apos;t be improves , dignity not only the lives of the human , but our dignity also . </s>
economists call this one , &quot; it &apos;s a <unk> technique . </s>
<unk> is that it &apos;s all about getting all the things that it &apos;s all about -- because all of these big selection selection . </s>
finally , reading this cartoon , reading this cartoon , and you &apos;re a person , &quot; ah ! what this fish ? &quot; </s>
you know , it &apos;s not possible to this <unk> . &quot; </s>
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first . </s>
the more i think about the age of the fish that i &apos;d been seeing with the fish . </s>
because the truth is that if you &apos;re doing the <unk> that all possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis . </s>
if you break the <unk> that everything is possible , they &apos;re going to happiness . </s>
they increase the happiness and the happiness . </s>
everybody needs a <unk> . </s>
this is almost a physical security too -- possibly even for the fish , definitely for us . </s>
but the <unk> is from a <unk> <unk> , and i guess , disaster , disaster . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about human genome and what it could mean , and about the discovery of new groups , and about the discovery of new groups . </s>
in fact , we start from a new point of view : we have the biology and now try to preserve the digital code and now we &apos;re now trying to build new kinds of biology . </s>
we &apos;ve always tried to ask questions . </s>
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists tried to understand that many biologists tried to understand and build on different levels . </s>
we have different kinds of different components in the world . </s>
we almost almost nearly 20 years , when we &apos;ve been released , we &apos;ve sequenced the <unk> , the analog world in the digital regions of the computer network . </s>
now let &apos;s try to be able to regenerate , whether we can make a new life , or whether we can make new life , from the digital universe ? </s>
this is the map of a little organism , an <unk> , which is the smallest genome that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to try and have a more genome genome . </s>
we &apos;ve managed to feed about 300 genes of the 500 genes or so that are here . </s>
but if we look at this map , the very simple is very simple , in comparison with an existing one , trust me , that &apos;s the simple one , but if we all look forward to a living cell , it would lead to a living cell . </s>
so , we decided to ensure that it actually the only way to go to the front of the thing is actually what gives us the individual components and so forth . </s>
and so we started to think about a chromosome ? </s>
it allows you to make these really big molecules of what was never done before ? </s>
and when we can start that , we can start to the chromosome ? </s>
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> material . </s>
our steps in the world is exponentially . </s>
our ability to write a genetic code , but we still evolving , and our final point would be , and our final point would be on a curve . </s>
we started doing this before that started . </s>
it took some years ago with a <unk> conference before we were the first experiments . </s>
how it turns out to be very difficult . </s>
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world can manufacture the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you have a bit of power , the more mistakes . </s>
so we had to have a new method of developing countries and the mistakes , they could be able to correct . </s>
so this was our first attempt to start using information , the genome x <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria . </s>
we built little pieces , made a <unk> , and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . </s>
the exciting phase came to us when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and a bacteria , and the bacteria started to read and build the genetic code . </s>
the viral viral particles were growing by the cells and came back and <unk> e. . </s>
and i &apos;ve talked to the oil and they said that they were just going to be a model . </s>
they laughed more than you do . </s>
so that &apos;s what we think is in the software actually , the most important thing can build in a biological system . </s>
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome , and it has more than <unk> letters , we thought we &apos;re going to build a whole <unk> chromosome to understand what the individuals of the <unk> system is a living cell . </s>
design is the key , and when you &apos;re in with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really <unk> . </s>
when we did the genome first 1995 , the <unk> had been able to take 10,000 consequences per 10,000 . </s>
we found the <unk> <unk> of the error . if we had the originals , they had never been able to have been possible . </s>
part of the design is to create pieces of the letters , and they need to build the other letters of all the <unk> to build smaller programs . </s>
we have unique elements here . </s>
you may have heard that we have <unk> . </s>
do you think about this : we have a <unk> code : a &quot; , c , g and the <unk> &quot; t. &quot; </s>
so , <unk> of these letters -- these letters did about 20 amino 20 , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each one of those amino acids . </s>
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts . </s>
initially , we only signed up . </s>
some people were having a poetry . </s>
we have the pieces of the pieces that we could easily , and there are enzymes with the way we could do it again and again . </s>
and we started to build pieces of starting with the <unk> letters , using the <unk> letters , local to <unk> these <unk> to <unk> these days . </s>
in every step , we &apos;ve been able to do this stuff in the surplus system , we could sequence a very robust process , because we tried to create a robust process . </s>
we tried to get the point of <unk> . </s>
so , this looks like a <unk> . </s>
if we &apos;re very , to get to these properly , with over 100,000 , we &apos;re not just going to grow up and just in e. , it &apos;s not just a simple one of modern molecular biology . </s>
we know from a mechanism of the <unk> <unk> , the biology of dna , the biology uses can be able to assemble . </s>
here &apos;s a example of it . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of three million rads of radiation . </s>
you see in the upper field that is just going to be a simple thing . </s>
12 , 24 hours later , he was all like it was so potent . </s>
we can do that . </s>
these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can actually make them happen in the vacuum . </s>
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life is in space and moving along the quest for a <unk> . </s>
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there . </s>
so here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we created by using these processes -- actually , we have been using <unk> using the right design of the brain design , we have them <unk> . yeast <unk> . </s>
this is not a <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s so big molecule that we can see it in the <unk> . </s>
these are shots about a <unk> of six seconds . </s>
this is the publication bias , we &apos;ve got to have done . </s>
these are <unk> letters in <unk> , and it &apos;s the most complicated molecule with <unk> structure that &apos;s ever created by people . </s>
it has a <unk> of 300 million . </s>
if we were to be able to grow it with a <unk> of 10 and without tearing up the ground , just to get rid of this genetic code . </s>
now , how do we start to do it ? how did we get it ? </s>
clearly , it &apos;s very simple with a virus &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria . </s>
it &apos;s equally simple when you &apos;re in <unk> like we are doing it , you just get the only one and you &apos;ll just get a different and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about the client . </s>
in <unk> , the chromosome is in the cell , but we &apos;ve showed that the entire transplant but we showed a full set of a cell to a cell to the other change and that activate . </s>
we &apos;re <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . roughly , these are these two very same as humans and mice , we gave some <unk> <unk> , and it was very amazing than we could destroy this chromosome -- and it was very amazing than we could destroy this chromosome . </s>
the new chromosome was to go into the cell . </s>
in fact , we thought that this is the end of the end , but we &apos;re trying to get a process . </s>
this is the <unk> of evolution here . </s>
we all find all kinds of species here , a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , every time in just a second <unk> in just a species . </s>
so humans , evolution has been to think of evolution as a gene at a moment , a lot of biology . </s>
there are enzymes of the <unk> , actually , dna . </s>
the chromosome in the cell was a lot of money ; the chromosomes was that we have . </s>
it was done in the cell and the other chromosome and realized the other chromosome as a physical material , and so we had one cell at the end of a new chromosome . </s>
it &apos;s actually blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve been described . </s>
and after a very short time , it had been lost all the characteristics of species and <unk> in a new species based on the new software that we have in the cell . </s>
all of the protein change that the <unk> changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was just that we have the genetic code . </s>
it may sound like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can make the <unk> change , things quite dramatic . </s>
now i &apos;m not saying that this is not the <unk> &apos;s -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years ago evolution . </s>
and i &apos;ve measured that we may be able to create a new form of the explosion explosion in the world in massive new forms of this stuff . </s>
why should we do that ? </s>
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need . </s>
we &apos;re basically <unk> by six billion people in the next 40 years . </s>
to try to put it in the year , i was in the year . </s>
today , three people on this planet is within the planet for every year , within 40 years , it &apos;s within 40 years . </s>
we have problems with food , with some water , and clean water , fuel for the sake of the people . </s>
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine . </s>
we need five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels . that &apos;s a hundred million <unk> on the day . </s>
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge . </s>
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 of the stuff that we &apos;ve been doing in the atmosphere . </s>
we now have been working from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that this is the <unk> of the future . </s>
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of the diversity . </s>
we see here in the very , the limitations of biological reality and the one of our our imagination . </s>
we have now technologies now because of this fast <unk> to what we call <unk> genetics . </s>
we have now the ability to build a big robot to build the millions of the millions of chromosomes . </s>
if you look at these 20 million different genes , these processes to optimize or drugs , or drugs , we can actually change a little more team than the last 20 years . </s>
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> <unk> production , production of chemicals , and so on . </s>
this is a recording that we work with , with the fact that you actually sit and new species of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the computer <unk> . </s>
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it is . we know what whose genetic code is going to look like . </s>
we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation . </s>
you &apos;ve got to get a little bit of ethanol , which is just a bad experiment . </s>
we have the <unk> and third generation of the generation , the <unk> generation are going to have higher <unk> , like <unk> , or <unk> species of <unk> . </s>
but we think that only the only way of biology is a huge impact on food or limitation of their availability , and we &apos;re working on layering cells as a limb , and so we &apos;re working on the cells that we go to the way that availability of cells go to the way that we go to the way that we go to the way that we go
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first of <unk> of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months . </s>
sunlight are a method -- -- we are sunlight -- and co2 are a method . </s>
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different methods . </s>
this is a organism we &apos;ve been hearing . </s>
he lives in the sea , about <unk> miles deep , <unk> <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s rooted in methane about the use of hydrogen as a source . </s>
we study the footprint of using co2 as easy to <unk> , which is just the co2 in the city of co2 , to the co2 scale . </s>
within a short period of time , we could be able to solve the fundamental questions of life . </s>
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the south pole industry is exactly the same thing , right . right . right . right . </s>
but equally , we &apos;re working on that same thing that &apos;s the same way that we use to use the development of physical exploration . </s>
you saw it with the flu , we &apos;re always a year back and little back , and they have a dollar , it &apos;s about the right vaccine . </s>
i think that &apos;s what you can do by using <unk> vaccines in the <unk> . </s>
this is what the future might look like , today , today , today is accelerating by synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re looking at a moment of people , and our goal is to survive that we have a chance to survive , thank you very much , that &apos;s too much ! </s>
on the last ted conference , i was a primer for the lhc . </s>
and i promised to come back to explain what the machine works . </s>
so , it &apos;s so far . and for all those who were the back that weren &apos;t there , who has ever been the most scientific science experiment -- 27 miles in diameter . </s>
so his task is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second , start to 600 million times in a second . </s>
it &apos;s just breathtaking a moral ambitious . </s>
this is the machine <unk> . </s>
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors . </s>
and this is what i &apos;m working on . he calls it to take a detector -- 44 meters in diameter . </s>
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas of the atlas in the construction and seeing the way around the world . </s>
last september , last year was starting to go back to the first time . </s>
and this picture was taken by atlas . </s>
it &apos;s very embarrassing in the middle . </s>
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that came out of the lhc , then with a part of the lhc , the <unk> , the rain of particles to make a zillion in the detector . </s>
in other words , when we saw this picture of the 10th of the 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph of a big triumph . </s>
i don &apos;t know if this is the largest <unk> thing , or this , as someone who was the google side and the front of the paper . </s>
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific . </s>
about a week after this , there was a problem with the machine that &apos;s been linked to this with this , this golden <unk> here -- these golden dots here . </s>
this wires <unk> <unk> when the machine hits the machine . </s>
now , the engineers under you , and say , &quot; no , no , that &apos;s the little wires . &quot; </s>
you can afford that , because if you feel very far cold , they will be <unk> . </s>
in minus the minus <unk> , the way between stars , the wires between stars , the wires of tension . </s>
in one of the connections between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> . </s>
by the time , the wires of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> resistance . </s>
this was the result . </s>
now , it &apos;s all the big thing when you think about 20 tons of 20 tons of the time , and it &apos;s about 30 inches . </s>
so we &apos;re interested in 50 of the magnets of the magnet . </s>
and they had to be able to take . </s>
we <unk> them , <unk> them . </s>
they &apos;re all going to come back to the way back . </s>
and then the lhc will be more <unk> to be the lhc . </s>
we will take him to the way we will expect first data in june or the july of july , and we &apos;ll start the journey to try to figure out what the building blocks is the universe . </s>
now of course , in a way , of course , in a way that the debate is about the debate of science and <unk> of the limits . it &apos;s easy to get a little bit . </s>
i think that it is so hard that we &apos;re going to reach out that we &apos;re going to reach out of our limits , the value of things like the lhc . </s>
i &apos;m going to be my favorite word of words , a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who was like , &quot; nothing is dangerous for the development of human spirit , and that there is no new worlds for the development of human spirit , and that there is no new worlds for the development . &quot; </s>
thank you very much . </s>
i &apos;m a novelist . </s>
books is my profession , but it &apos;s obviously than that , of course . </s>
it &apos;s also my big , and his fascination , and fascination . </s>
and i don &apos;t change the change . </s>
but i think , in my mind , my career and my career , and my career has been to rethink my own terms . </s>
this is a very popular event that i &apos;ve been recently written a book called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , love , love , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m treated , i &apos;m going to be treated in the garden . </s>
! </s>
for instance , they come to me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t fear , &quot; don &apos;t fear that they never be happy . </s>
they don &apos;t have any afraid of their entire life and never meet a book , and a book , a book in the world ? </s>
okay , the really courage . </s>
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i was first first of the first time , when i told that first of all , i wanted to be able to be able to get a <unk> response to me . </s>
people said , don &apos;t fear , never succeeded ? </s>
you have no fear that &apos;s been <unk> to a <unk> ? </s>
do not afraid that you &apos;re going to print this , and it never comes to a <unk> dreams and that you can never get on a <unk> dreams of your dreams -- your mouth of the failure ? </s>
so , you know , you know , you know . </s>
the answer to all these questions is : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things . </s>
and i always had . </s>
and i have a lot more interesting to fear that no one would be . </s>
like algae -- and other things are <unk> . </s>
but when i think about , i think i &apos;ve been looking for what &apos;s going to be a little bit about why ? </s>
is that the reasonable ? </s>
is it logical that &apos;s logical and that should be done by that he &apos;s fear of having a job to do it ? </s>
and what &apos;s right ? the creative thing is that they &apos;re interested in the computational -- in a way , like it does not do ? </s>
my dad , for instance , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember myself as a chemist , he was asked to be afraid to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be chemists . </s>
with your favorite <unk> , john -- how about you get ? </s>
it was simple ? </s>
but to be fair , the group of chemists have been about centuries of <unk> people &apos;s most likely to get their call . </s>
we seem to have this kind of stuff . but not only the writers , but not only the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , is mentally unstable . </s>
all of you have to do is the bitter <unk> of a really great picture of the 20th century , the young and often of whom , and often of whom , from their hand . </s>
and even the ones who didn &apos;t actually get <unk> <unk> , ceo of their <unk> . </s>
norman <unk> said , his death was his death in his last year , <unk> , <unk> , my books , my books , my books . </s>
one extraordinary message that you can do about your own . </s>
but we don &apos;t even think if we hear someone &apos;s going to hear something like this , because we have this kind of <unk> for so long , somehow we have the notion of all the time . </s>
the question i want to share today is : is this idea for you to do that for you to be completely in order to fix them . </s>
feel about that ? because with only one inch , i feel like only , i feel that the notion of all that the notion of all that . </s>
i find them . </s>
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to check out how to take the next century . </s>
i think it &apos;s better when we &apos;re doing our greatest creative jobs . </s>
and i definitely know that it &apos;s been definitely for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , very dangerous , a dark path of the presumption -- especially in the fact that i just thought about my career . </s>
that &apos;s called -- look pretty young . i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m pretty young . </s>
i may have a 40 of <unk> to me . </s>
and it &apos;s extremely likely to write anything from now to write about the work of my mind , the most exciting success of my last book was my last year ? </s>
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s <unk> , because we &apos;re all now -- it &apos;s extremely likely to be friends -- it &apos;s extremely probable that my greatest success . </s>
oh ! what a thought ! </s>
these are the kind of thought that can get somebody to drink , and i don &apos;t want to drink . and i don &apos;t want to drink . </s>
i would rather continue to work . </s>
so the question is : how ? </s>
after a time of course , after a time of the <unk> seems to be able to write a kind of <unk> psychological . </s>
somehow , i have to find a way to find a way to find a safe distance between me and my very natural appreciation of how the response to the <unk> . </s>
while i was in the last year , after looking for it , i have been to find other kinds of better or more ideas about how to do creative or <unk> ideas about how to help creative people who connected to creativity , with creativity . </s>
and i made this quest to greece that rome . </s>
please follow me , because the circle will close again . </s>
but in ancient greece , rome didn &apos;t believe that creativity of people , ok ? </s>
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> who was from a distant <unk> , <unk> source of <unk> , unknown reasons -- from <unk> , unknown . </s>
the greeks called the <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
and by socrates from socrates , he thought he had believed he had a <unk> that &apos;s been liberated from the ground . </s>
the romans <unk> the same idea , this kind of <unk> creative <unk> <unk> . </s>
this is great . the <unk> thought that a particular genius was a particularly smart . </s>
they believed that a genius that was made of the kind of potential that it was going to be done in the walls of a <unk> , which was that it literally divided -- the <unk> and the performers of work , <unk> , the result of work . </s>
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological distance that i talked about the consequences of your work . </s>
and everybody knew that it worked , right ? </s>
the artist &apos;s artist was protected by the other things , as we were talking to the case , for example , too much , right ? </s>
if you were doing your work , you didn &apos;t look at all for you to <unk> yourself , everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that has helped you ever been . </s>
if your work <unk> -- not entirely entirely -- your fault , right ? </s>
everybody knew about it , it was something that was happening . </s>
so people have been working on the world &apos;s really incredible time . </s>
and then the renaissance and everything changed everything . we had this big idea of the universe , and this big idea was : let &apos;s have the human genome -- all the great individual was , and there &apos;s no space for the <unk> creatures that commands to do . </s>
it &apos;s the dawn of the rational system and the people started to think that creativity has been to be a completely different from the own individual . </s>
for the first time in history , you may have people that have a genius -- instead of that he &apos;s a genius -- instead of that he has a genius . </s>
i have to tell you , i think that was a great mistake . </s>
do you know , i think , a person , to allow you to allow a male person that he thinks he was thinking , he &apos;s thinking , he &apos;s thinking , he &apos;s a little bit too much responsibility to a <unk> , human psychology , name is a little bit too much about the <unk> of human psychology . </s>
it &apos;s like somebody else &apos;s sun . </s>
the middle and the whole thing is , and it does all these <unk> expectations to the success . </s>
i think that this <unk> has increased our artists for the last 500 years . </s>
and i think it &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true : it &apos;s the question of it : i think it &apos;s the question . </s>
can we change it ? </s>
perhaps to a moment that &apos;s the relationship between humans and the mystery of the creative capacity . </s>
maybe not . </s>
and maybe we can &apos;t even <unk> the <unk> from 500 years in a <unk> lecture . </s>
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience that really <unk> <unk> doubt , would be the notion of the notion of -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects . </s>
i &apos;m probably not going to be all of you in this journey . </s>
but the question i want to reach to the point is not ? </s>
why not so much ? </s>
because it makes the same sense of how everything else i &apos;ve heard about , if it was possible to explain the possible possible process of creative process . </s>
one process that &apos;s been tried -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so everyone here : actually everybody here -- not always quite tried . </s>
in fact , he can feel <unk> . </s>
i had to have a encounter when i met the united states as i met the moral american professor of the <unk> stone , but her entire life was working for her life , but her entire life was , they would feel like a poem about the landscape . she would told me that the landscape of landscape . </s>
she said it would be like a <unk> train , from the air , and she said it would be like a <unk> train . </s>
the country on it was <unk> . </s>
they felt when it came to the earth , because it would take the earth underneath their feet . </s>
she knew that she could be able to do one of these things , and that was -- in her words , <unk> <unk> like the devil <unk> . </s>
she ran like the devil , when the house was tracked from this poem , it was just simply just to put them quickly enough to a sheet of paper and a pen , so it was just to put it through it , and the <unk> of it . </s>
and other paint didn &apos;t mean it &apos;s enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran and ran the house , but she didn &apos;t stare the house to go back and ran the house to a different poet , and as she said , &quot; <unk> <unk> . </s>
and then there was this moments -- the part i never forget , she was saying that there were moments of moments where they were almost done . </s>
so she &apos;s looking at the house and the <unk> , and the poem you see , and the poem you see through them and then — she goes a pen , it was so passionately going to give his other hand to grab her hand . </s>
she goes back to his tail and pulled it back into their bodies and took it on the paper . </s>
and at this particular came , the poem was , and intact on paper , but backwards from the paper -- from the last word to the first . </s>
when i heard this , i thought that &apos;s a <unk> thing -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process . </s>
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel ! </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> . i have to go back to the same time and sweat , i have to go back to the same time and really blend me . </s>
but even i even <unk> this thing in my <unk> , sometimes this thing . </s>
and i guess many of you have done this . </s>
i even had to work or ideas that from a source of me through me , i can &apos;t identify . </s>
what is it a thing ? </s>
and how do we even do that in relationship with our mind , but we &apos;re actually going to lose the opposite of our minds ? </s>
for me , the best living example of this can do this , how do you create the musician , i got to a magazine a magazine . </s>
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? the most time of his life was tom <unk> the embodiment of modern <unk> , who was trying to master this <unk> <unk> that was trying to master this <unk> in the bookstore and with them . </s>
but then he got older and he was convicted of him , he told me that he was a day in los angeles , and there was everything for him . </s>
he was driving up with high speed as he suddenly sounds a little fragment of a melody , which is difficult to <unk> , and he wants to be a little more difficult . he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> , but he can &apos;t tell you . </s>
he didn &apos;t paper , he didn &apos;t have a pen , he didn &apos;t have a <unk> . </s>
so he begins to the old <unk> in the way , how to lose , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and i &apos;ll lose this thing , and i &apos;ll lose this song in this particular age . </s>
i &apos;m not good enough ; i don &apos;t recommend it . </s>
but instead of having it , he &apos;s just going to be just looking at . </s>
he took all the same thing and he &apos;s doing something completely new . </s>
he just looked in the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , can you see that i &apos;m going to be a car ? </s>
i see this is how i could do a song ? </s>
if you really want to come to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you . </s>
if not , <unk> , another person . </s>
go cohen , <unk> cohen . </s>
his whole <unk> has changed after it . </s>
not the work itself . that was a lot of dark as well as fixing jobs and the ones . </s>
but the process and the heavy <unk> , who surrounds him to come back to where he hadn &apos;t been out as a anger and it then <unk> where he had nothing to go and see him , he realized it wasn &apos;t a <unk> thing . </s>
it could be a <unk> , <unk> , brilliant collaboration between tom and the <unk> , love , the thing that hasn &apos;t been quite tom . </s>
when i was having this story , it was a little bit like i worked and it has been rescued by me once . </s>
i saved this idea of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , love , love , love , love , love , love that will be written . that &apos;s the worst book that &apos;s written in the worst book . </s>
not just bad , but the worst thing happens . </s>
i started thinking about the project . </s>
but then i reminded myself as tom in the &apos; sky , and i tried it . </s>
so i &apos;ve lifted my view of the manuscript and talking to my comment in direction . </s>
i was writing by the <unk> , <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s not a lot of my fault , right ? </s>
because you see , i guess everything i have , i didn &apos;t have more than that . </s>
if you want to have better , you have to have the same thing and your stake is <unk> . </s>
ok , but you know , if you don &apos;t do that , you know , it &apos;s the devil . </s>
i &apos;m going to write that this is my job . </s>
and i want to make a point today for my part right here . </s>
because ... ... at the end of it is how follows . so , in centuries of the <unk> people with saints in deserts and music that are <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , to the dawn of the heart . </s>
these are always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic . </s>
but again , it &apos;s very rare , what happened to be a special thing . one of the <unk> was actually done . </s>
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;re all in your life at a life that you saw in your life . </s>
it was a time when he was the time of the <unk> and the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> . he did not have been able to get it in the last thing -- 1,000 nights before -- but all of it together . </s>
all of a sudden , he seemed to human . </s>
he was convicted by the inside , and from the bottom and the <unk> <unk> , through a <unk> fire . </s>
when something was happening , people knew what was happening . they called it with his name . </s>
they put hands together , and they started singing , <unk> , god , god , god , god , god , god . </s>
this is god , you know ? </s>
interesting historic historic : as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you &apos;re still in <unk> and <unk> . </s>
if a medical student in spain , something magical , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is a <unk> view of god . </s>
and that &apos;s great , because we need . </s>
but , but the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancers itself was , &quot; the <unk> <unk> , &quot; it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday way -- and he didn &apos;t think about a <unk> of god . </s>
he &apos;s merely a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> . and maybe he never returned to this place . </s>
and maybe somebody will never get when he gets out when he rotates , but what does he start with the rest of his life ? </s>
that &apos;s heavy . </s>
this is a <unk> performance of a creative life . </s>
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be as if it &apos;s not going to be the case of your mind if they don &apos;t believe the most aspects of their lives . </s>
if you &apos;re just believe that they &apos;re a worldview -- from a <unk> source of their life that will be passed on someone else &apos;s life that &apos;s going to be on someone else &apos;s going to be done with it . </s>
when we think about it , it changes everything . </s>
so i started thinking , and so i think i started with certainty and so i think with certainty in the book that soon seem to be working on -- when the dangerous , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
what i have to say , if i &apos;m going to go to this crazy , there is no fear . </s>
it &apos;s not a disaster . </s>
just your job . </s>
it &apos;s still a fish for your contribution , and what he is doing , it &apos;s always been going to be . </s>
when you &apos;re doing a job , experiment . </s>

i want to start with you , at the time of their childhood , when they were playing with <unk> , they were playing with <unk> . </s>
while they realized , how to get hands and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and moved to thinking of that , they actually learned to have to understand and change the way . </s>
it &apos;s closely to think of it , how we understand a lot of our surroundings . </s>
as a final -- inspired by the way our interaction with real objects -- and combined with my colleague objects , and combined with my colleague objects , i started to wonder , what if we could use computers , instead of a <unk> , and they could transform so many important messages that could we ? </s>
this is so much that we were to learn to the full answer and <unk> developed . </s>
and a <unk> is a <unk> computer in the size of a <unk> . </s>
you can move with hand , they can be able to each other , they can put their movements and they have a screen and a <unk> . </s>
more importantly , physically , is physically , why you can &apos;t reach out like the <unk> and the health system . </s>
and the <unk> are a example of a new generation of <unk> information to the digital digital data . </s>
and if these tools are physical , and a awareness of awareness of their own <unk> , and the subtleties of our <unk> , with them , then we can start with the local new treatment and <unk> . </s>
i start with some simple examples . </s>
and this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i get it into a direction , the video gets far , if i put it into the other direction , it &apos;s backwards . </s>
and this interactive portraits is true . </s>
if i put them side , you can get your interest . </s>
if you &apos;re surrounded surrounded , you can also notice that , and can you also find something nervous . </s>
and they feel like this , and they &apos;re feeling like this . </s>
one interesting choice of interactions that we started to realize that we could transform the data to the data , like , about color , how to deal with it . </s>
in this case , we have three <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to be able to use color in the middle of the center where they are speaking . </s>
if we overdo it , we can actually <unk> a little <unk> . </s>
there are also some nice ways in education like languages , mathematics , mathematics , where we can give the people the possibility of the global commons , and the results can see instantly . </s>

then , about 30 seconds , and you &apos;ve come back and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
these are some kids who came to a trip to the media lab , and i could get them to move it out and i was a video of it . </s>
they really loved it . </s>
a interestingly of applications in this kind of applications that you don &apos;t have a lot of instructions to give it many instructions . </s>
all you have to say is &quot; &quot; dirty words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do . </s>
here &apos;s a couple of people who are doing it . </s>
this is our current <unk> atmosphere in the bottom right there . </s>
it turned out to <unk> the <unk> just wanted to watch . </s>
so they just <unk> . </s>
this is a interactive <unk> . </s>
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> . </s>
this is a <unk> . </s>
he can get new characters in the scene by using the <unk> of the table that this character is showing . </s>
here he is working . </s>
the sun is on the sun . </s>
he gets a tractor in the scene . </s>
orange booms . </s>
good news ! yes ! </s>
by doing the <unk> shake and she can take the characters , he can interact the characters . </s>
... his own story . </s>
hi ! </s>
it &apos;s a story with respect and he can decide how they &apos;re developing . </s>
flying cat . </s>
the last example i spent today , i &apos;m a <unk> for a <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as sounds as <unk> , and <unk> and drums and simulation . </s>
every one has four different variations , you can pick up that , which is to use . </s>
and you can see this sounds in sequence that you can see in a lonely tree . </s>
and you &apos;re <unk> , just by a <unk> of a <unk> . </s>
there are effects that you can transform live live with a live , like the hall and it filters . </s>
you get it with a particular note and tends to do it . </s>
and then , even more effects of speed and volume that you can do on the sequence of the sequence . </s>
so let &apos;s see , we &apos;ll see . </s>
we start in that where we put the <unk> in two <unk> <unk> and this one set up and a little more , more than a little bit of voice . </s>
now i &apos;m going to pull a bass . </s>
now i &apos;m going to do something about it . </s>
and now , as i &apos;m a living with the drums of this , i can use the effect on this effect . </s>
i can accelerate the whole sequence , i put it on a <unk> or other direction . </s>
and now i &apos;m a little <unk> to something like this , for something more expression . </s>
i can take care of the sequence of the time . </s>
and so , in this way , i don &apos;t have to plan to be planning , but it can make a difference . </s>
and finally , i can browse the whole sequence by drawing by the side of the left . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
so you can see my desire to develop new <unk> , new <unk> that are getting better to the way our brains and bodies work . </s>
and today , i had time to time , you know , this new <unk> and some of the ways we work in our lab . </s>
the idea that i want to give you with the way that we want to explore at the threshold of interaction with digital media &apos;s generation , the information that we bring information to the world that are able to bring our demands . </s>
thank you very much , i know , thanks to . </s>
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversations with them all ! </s>
yes , good afternoon . </s>
i &apos;m a maker . </s>
yes , what should be <unk> ? </s>
i have to be a little bit of a single <unk> , and it &apos;s called the <unk> of modern molecular biology . </s>
i study molecular biology and i &apos;m just now with the <unk> , and i started to know because i just wanted to know , and i started because i wanted to know what i learned in the study . </s>
so this was my primary motivation . </s>
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to sort of a closer and i wanted to do the matter . </s>
i think that the molecular biology is now all right now , biotechnology , all you count , all you count , synthetic biology , and so on , we kept biology and so on . </s>
extremely important is now , is extremely important , much more important in the future , much more important in the future . </s>
there are so things that are <unk> things like this whole decade , in the <unk> . </s>
now there are craig venter now in the <unk> , which tries to make a <unk> , which is gasoline . </s>
there &apos;s also already things that are absolutely in everyday , which most people but not realize is the fact that allow us to wash up with <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> enzymes , are also vulnerable <unk> enzymes . </s>
and the list can continue . </s>
and so from interest to the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to go on the <unk> . </s>
so what &apos;s why we have to do ? </s>
most people know what the <unk> is about . </s>
computers , and then it &apos;s going to be so much , that the hacker break somewhere else somewhere and claws and so forth . </s>
that &apos;s kind of a kind of sad for the <unk> because that &apos;s not what it &apos;s actually the true thing that started doing and what &apos;s actually doing . </s>
and that &apos;s what the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> and that &apos;s also the internet , and it &apos;s also the internet . </s>
and it &apos;s about to solve a whole range of potential , creative ways to solve the problem . </s>
and the problem is not just a technical problem , it can be a problem of a problem , it can also be a <unk> thing , which can also be a <unk> , a question , and how can you do better than how you can do it . </s>
and it &apos;s been a toy , it &apos;s been with the software , but there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that there is also a whole <unk> that make up with all kinds of things . </s>
and now , i &apos;m also exploring biology , and i want to take this metaphor , which is that biology , is actually a <unk> , because , the <unk> code is actually a <unk> because it matter , so it &apos;s a <unk> because it matter , so it &apos;s not just the way it matter , and not just <unk> . </s>
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it and you can also program it , so , and i just wanted to find it fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot of deeper . </s>
this has just been really quite <unk> for eight form of these networks . </s>
there is <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is in the switzerland and with a cooperation in india , but with a cooperation of india , but it &apos;s about <unk> people all over the world . </s>
that &apos;s what a lot of artistic stuff is there , there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and working with scientists and working with scientists and <unk> with scientists and questioning and the creative thing , there &apos;s <unk> and yes . </s>
but it &apos;s always about to find a way to find a <unk> to have a <unk> approach to have a heart attack . </s>
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> . </s>
this is from the <unk> a network , which is actually a kind of a <unk> where you can get to where you move . </s>
so the best ones also have to do , and also a little bit of <unk> <unk> , there are also so <unk> questions . </s>
and based on these networks that have been made the whole thing , has made a scene that i &apos;d like to take for a minute . </s>
here in the upper left on the left is a <unk> , so that &apos;s a <unk> , so a private school , a private school , it &apos;s a private school where everyone can do . </s>
kids , old , all sorts of people go to the next thing , just to get them a lab and look at what you can do when they do that . </s>
here &apos;s the bottom of the bottom is a group of indonesia , <unk> , the law is quite a long time . </s>
and we were using it as these other two networks . </s>
and the other thing in which is also so dense with biological materials and , yes , also , <unk> , and maybe even the way it kind of sounds . </s>
a group of applications i &apos;ve got a while ago , a while ago , which have been a <unk> , who wanted to be a <unk> , who wanted to be a <unk> , which is a <unk> , and people try to explain what &apos;s going on . </s>
and i &apos;ve got a lecture in a lecture to the other <unk> in a <unk> museum with a exhibition . </s>
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , yes , is mostly people , but the only thing that &apos;s all the main characteristics is this fascination , this is the fascination of the technology . </s>
and what you can do with that , and also , you know , the society is doing , and to ask what you want to do with you , you know , they need to get interested in so you ? </s>
so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you need to kind of stuff . </s>
you need biological materials , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory . </s>
by looking at what you normally below under a lab , which is so sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive machines , extremely <unk> machines , just <unk> , <unk> , <unk> academics with the <unk> and so on . </s>
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually don &apos;t have to do that . </s>
that &apos;s not necessary , because every any <unk> has been known technology technology , actually , <unk> technology is really like most <unk> , that &apos;s really like this . </s>
and s o with this premise with this premise of an example of brian <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , then , a <unk> <unk> , then , yes , so <unk> , and then it &apos;s <unk> bacteria , and then it &apos;s <unk> bacteria . </s>
so every one that has a soup <unk> is that he has been standing up to the long time . </s>
i &apos;ve tried this in my lab , a little bit of a <unk> , and i have bought so <unk> on ebay and a little bit analysis to ebay and a little <unk> analysis , so <unk> <unk> <unk> , even more <unk> . </s>
so that &apos;s not a joke , but it &apos;s not a joke . </s>
here in the bottom here , you see the lab in <unk> , so that &apos;s such a <unk> garage with so much as a <unk> garage garage , which is a <unk> garage with so much , i want to have a project a group in paris , i want to have a project a little project . </s>
and this is <unk> , who also <unk> , that &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> in the principle of biology . </s>
and yes , you can see it &apos;s relatively relative to <unk> , so that there are a lot of people who make the way up to large , until large organizations that are actually producing the more tightly in the form of forms . </s>
but the fact is that it &apos;s simply a simple thing to be just a lot of it and accessible . </s>
the first project we &apos;ve done as a international group of our self , we were here now as a real <unk> , we have now been here as a real <unk> , and we know that the people who always are doing and so the people who always have been doing . </s>
and then the <unk> <unk> was website of the founder of the founder , and has told that we &apos;ve been told a <unk> in london , <unk> 10 , and then , two of them in the <unk> , <unk> 10 , and shortly on the <unk> , in san francisco . </s>
and then , there was something like that , yes , we &apos;re what we want to do what we want to do , what we want to do ? </s>
and what are our values and what is our textbooks , our basis ? </s>
and then we have a <unk> <unk> . </s>
so that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just his desires , his and what makes him , what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s going to be operating . </s>
there was a very good thing to do a whole good time . </s>
and the reason we have , is not the big , but that &apos;s what i think is , i think , well , i think , is there &apos;s right kind of stuff that people are quite rightly . </s>
and we even tried to try and even try and also have the academic world , but there &apos;s no way to go . </s>
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> &apos; 50s in the way that the world is already even more than the world . </s>
yes , we actually do this ? </s>
a project i made with the <unk> in switzerland , we &apos;ve made a so-called <unk> <unk> in switzerland or <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s when you &apos;re a laser beam , in a space , in space , you can make it small particles in the room , and then it can move into this focus , so that &apos;s where the one such <unk> in the principle and the principle of the principle . </s>
that &apos;s really working that &apos;s done in the academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , that we can also have a webcam , and then , <unk> , you can also get a microscope , the <unk> , you have a microscope to take a castle about <unk> . </s>
this looks at the bottom . </s>
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and then try to focus on this camera . </s>
and that unfortunately , not too , but we still have a lot of time . </s>
so another project that came from french <unk> , it &apos;s very cool . </s>
and it &apos;s got a way to have a paper that &apos;s like a <unk> , so he &apos;s going to be a <unk> , so he &apos;s <unk> with his <unk> &apos;s sam . </s>
he &apos;s got this helmet , because , in cooperation , in the <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
and then the visitors space could go in the room , in these chair , is the <unk> <unk> . </s>
then her experienced became the measured , and the after they were thinking , or how they were thinking about , is then different lights . </s>
a pretty typical project . </s>
another thing that &apos;s been doing with this <unk> , which also has been to do with this <unk> , which is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word . </s>
so it &apos;s about to copy genes , to enable you to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so you can make them visible . </s>
so when i go to the <unk> , then , you go down there , collecting all the <unk> , and then you can make the one that this way , and then you can say , <unk> , <unk> , this individual belongs to this people . </s>
and the machines that make something that are pretty much expensive that you &apos;re going to buy the cheapest , which is the cheapest <unk> . </s>
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot of a lot of them . </s>
so this is just a application of many that you can do with this . </s>
and they &apos;ve been so two fresh <unk> and said , <unk> , that we &apos;re going to make easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got a little bit of open , so that this device is the <unk> of the world &apos;s best interests and the most fundamental ones of these devices . </s>
i think , kind of a little bit of <unk> or something . </s>
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap cheap , but it &apos;s definitely on any case in a time where it &apos;s clear . </s>
so it &apos;s a very depressing <unk> . </s>
a project i had been started to build a <unk> . </s>
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> that &apos;s just about the same , which is like , two centimeter or so far . </s>
you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and then i have the <unk> and then i got the <unk> . </s>
so the device that you see is not working . </s>
but that &apos;s my own prototype , but rather it pretty much like the branch , so on a branch that would take off and print pressure , and that was the pressure was to be able to figure out the thing . </s>
and then i took a <unk> and it &apos;s plugged to it . </s>
a <unk> , if you do the full pressure with water , the enough pressure , i think <unk> , so <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
and so you can accelerate the particles and then go to the position of the onion in the onion . </s>
and this is commercial device costs about <unk> <unk> , or something , <unk> so something that &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically a principle . </s>
so this is where the <unk> of the scene of the scene is to increase the economic development and also the information and the <unk> and the <unk> to the extent that more people can be able to get together . </s>
because , as a beginning , it &apos;s a very strange technology , and most people have relatively little hunch and most people relatively little hunch of it and also have a really good thing to form yourself . </s>
because if you &apos;re just reading it , from <unk> , it &apos;s not the same thing as you did it or seen it once or seen it once . </s>
and i think technology is increasingly important in our modern societies . </s>
and if you want to get a <unk> citizen decisions in society , and then can &apos;t make the one , you need access to knowledge and technology for technology . </s>
and you have to do it and understand it , and they can understand it . </s>
and the <unk> then under the <unk> <unk> and <unk> . </s>
so that &apos;s when you get a citizen , just to get a <unk> with these kinds of technologies . </s>
and that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
these are the people who are officially at least in the website , <unk> website . </s>
this is a relatively mars number of people in the world . </s>
and interesting , you &apos;ve also southeast in southeast asia . </s>
this is me that are there are less people , as a way , as a species . </s>
so i know from some of some you that don &apos;t have . </s>
and that &apos;s just the <unk> people who are individual people . </s>
so , even with these <unk> , so that &apos;s the places there &apos;s this place . </s>
and this is very beginning . </s>
it &apos;s just beginning to start . </s>
and <unk> , the <unk> , because the <unk> was in berlin , <unk> . </s>
and this is a network network in a very good network , and that &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , the world all over the world . </s>
and we hope that we can also have the same as well as well as we can also also spread and similar well , that could be more wiser and more involved . </s>
and i would take everybody once , and also what was going on . </s>
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not possible if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity , if you &apos;re in your enough energy , you get to see enough and you get it . </s>
thanks for listening . </s>
that was . </s>
yes , hi . </s>
how do we actually work ? </s>
this is a question that makes me very moving , as a designer , but also in the realm of the <unk> <unk> and all kinds of things in the area in the area . </s>
it &apos;s about how to people in the interactive media and so it &apos;s about how to use this interactive media and so they created a very <unk> experience . </s>
i think that the interactive media is media in us , cognitive models , which is the <unk> , so we &apos;re talking about the biological models in our biological memory , and we can have the only one to build a structure . </s>
and that &apos;s very amazing because you think you think that this <unk> that that <unk> that you &apos;re going to be able to do in the future , but in fact , the future is what we &apos;re looking at our diplomacy . </s>
what are actually <unk> ? </s>
i have four <unk> , and i want to explain to just a little bit about . </s>
to <unk> cognitive models , and that &apos;s where we have risen in the pre-industrial times . </s>
so these wiki models models , that we &apos;ve been able to have a natural natural history of the patient . </s>
it sounds like a magician . </s>
i &apos;m going to go on to go and show you a natural ratio , you know , you know , you &apos;re a natural ratio . </s>
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been looking for that since because of that <unk> models of this process , we &apos;re very , very far , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language . </s>
and the third part of itself is actually . </s>
we know that the interactive media rate has been <unk> to the same media companies that involves the people who are familiar with us today , and what excites us says that we might feel like a normal level . </s>
the fourth point is that the story is a place of the <unk> . </s>
what about the virtuality that &apos;s actually the most important thing in the world . </s>
i want to prove . </s>
how many of the things you live in life ? </s>
we won &apos;t spontaneously answer , but it &apos;s going to answer , but it &apos;s going to happen to the moment . </s>
they go in the spirit of this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors there are . </s>
and that &apos;s what they do . </s>
they <unk> reality , and it &apos;s all without computers . </s>
fantastic , right ? </s>
and there &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at the most fundamental realities of reality in our <unk> , we can actually see the whole thing . </s>
and this is the virtual wealth of reality that have the reality that have the people in the pre-industrial times also had to have the other people in the pre-industrial times . </s>
they didn &apos;t have the books . </s>
or didn &apos;t have any <unk> . </s>
they didn &apos;t have a clean . </s>
her had the head , her head . </s>
and in this tank , the memory gets . </s>
in this mind , <unk> and <unk> of these virtual images , who are veterans , i &apos;ve been able to know the case . </s>
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality that we can deal with the patient &apos;s own . </s>
the interesting thing about it is when i can do a little more , you can make a little more . </s>
yes , that &apos;s what goes . </s>
the interesting thing about this is that the human being at the same time , and they were <unk> themselves . </s>
if you think about a piece of the things that you think . </s>
what are media ? </s>
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change in a change . </s>
but i &apos;ll talk about again . </s>
but also , the <unk> has been to have been a pair of <unk> . </s>
<unk> , <unk> , so-called <unk> , were for the extra story to preserve . </s>
and even today we still even hang out of stories . </s>
author of the book of the book , jonathan <unk> , we still <unk> , and we still have a <unk> <unk> hours of stories . </s>
this means for a kid that &apos;s been a kid that it &apos;s like the most of the most about the most of his life of stories . </s>
now , we think our love to the stories that we feel like as a child on the lap . </s>
no , far . </s>
this goes much more on the cultures of the pre-industrial times . </s>
but for me , the west media is particularly impressive media is that we have been able to feel like this in our biological memory of memory , the ability to think of the ability to think about the ability . </s>
i &apos;m a example of the <unk> tribe of the <unk> . </s>
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia . </s>
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very depressing area and you had to navigate the <unk> , from a island to the island . </s>
and they did this with such outrageous <unk> . </s>
you may know , you may have a little bit of interest , and you may be a little bit of a interest in the australian . </s>
they have similar principles . </s>
they haven &apos;t <unk> , but they have the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
and what the interesting thing about it is that the <unk> and the topography of regions over the songs . </s>
the language <unk> of <unk> was <unk> . </s>
that means you &apos;re talking about the sound and above rhythm . </s>
and these sound and of course , the geology have created a region of a region , and that allowed the course of a region and that allowed them to left and so on the left , and it &apos;s going to move back to the right and also again and again . </s>
why not take more to the top of a , from a <unk> to b ? </s>
anyway , to navigate . </s>
what &apos;s happening is that &apos;s what happened ? </s>
it &apos;s what &apos;s happening is the <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re moving in the way that we &apos;re looking at . </s>
it &apos;s the ultimate and it &apos;s happening that is the book , and it &apos;s what &apos;s happening . </s>
and that &apos;s what this is happening is we &apos;re going to have the responsibility for our memories and the reservoirs of our individual memories have been able to build external . </s>
and on the picture . </s>
so we &apos;ve unfortunately god god of god <unk> . </s>
and a lot of suddenly , a whole <unk> for us to do that , and has never been able to do anything else . </s>
bruce brown , a <unk> <unk> at the <unk> , is so far , that this is the <unk> and the picture , so we kept as a result of that , and the picture that we call as a result of our memories and our ability to <unk> our capacity . </s>
let &apos;s do a little <unk> . </s>
from the <unk> to the machine . </s>
what has been on our minds and our <unk> ? </s>
and then the <unk> <unk> of the elderly . </s>
and the ones are over the centuries of the centuries and more <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
that means instead of having to remember , far as we can see , far from the data that we can hang with our personal memories of memories of memories that we can ever hang out of our own memories . </s>
we don &apos;t produce more than itself . </s>
we have a abstract abstract language . </s>
we don &apos;t think we &apos;re not going to hire things in images , but we &apos;re not going to be able to rediscover our language . </s>
we used to be used to happen . </s>
and we have the linearity as law , and there &apos;s a lot of exceptions , like the <unk> . </s>
what &apos;s been consistent is the <unk> . </s>
still , we &apos;re still the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , very <unk> . </s>
now , what &apos;s going to happen ? </s>
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine and we put the so-called <unk> . </s>
sounds very <unk> and sounds very much , i know , i know . </s>
but the concepts of the <unk> that are able to take us back to the skill again . </s>
there &apos;s about a <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> . </s>
i want to just a little bit about it . </s>
there are also technological concepts like the <unk> reality , which is the extended reality . </s>
so if google <unk> <unk> , then there &apos;s such a concept of what makes us virtual world back to the world , which means we have the virtual world to <unk> the virtual behavior as a function of a thing , and it &apos;s going to be a bit more important . </s>
another example is so potent virtual reality . </s>
so , of course , the course of course , in the context of my mind , because we &apos;re not <unk> physically in a <unk> virtual , virtual worlds , totally after the same <unk> . </s>
another example is the most important , intelligent systems . </s>
these are spaces that can respond to a human . </s>
all of the skill , our fundamental ability to take care of the physical habitat . </s>
i came up with the degree and i hope that the video works , a very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . </s>
and the two <unk> are here today . </s>
maybe you can get up a little bit about , so you may have to talk about the two people . </s>
and this project i &apos;ve been studying as an example of how to think about this <unk> , cognitive models . </s>
all of the game i have to say , &quot; i have to say . </s>
what the <unk> of course is extremely , and it &apos;s a computer . </s>
and when i say , you know , you have a very few people who are people <unk> to people about <unk> <unk> , or she &apos;s playing with some of the things with some of these <unk> . </s>
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in the workforce . </s>
this is a game for the outside . </s>
and that &apos;s what i think i &apos;ve been studying is that i &apos;m the real world , so i &apos;ve been seeing the real world again . </s>
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the <unk> that we make , with the real world . </s>
i &apos;ve got to have a strong school . </s>
you can get the same better to try and get more more on it . </s>
and that &apos;s what &apos;s about that i &apos;ve been a city , by which places that i see , in which places that we &apos;ve been seeing or negative <unk> . </s>
and so i &apos;ve given a lot of the city of all other stuff , a whole different way , i see a negative and a whole city , and it &apos;s like a whole new city of a very real city . </s>
and we can now take a look at the time . </s>
ah , what you can see here is , you know , is a little explanation of what you see . </s>
of course , the virtual world in the walls of our cities , is clear . </s>
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make this virtual worlds visible . </s>
so i want to think about my talk and that &apos;s what my talk is that the properties and the abilities that we have made from the <unk> and the abilities that we have made from the <unk> , and that we have so a little bit about complex products , technological products , new products in fact not to be able to go back to our own . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
yes , i should be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
i was asked to see if this is a <unk> of a chick , and my talk is a <unk> device . </s>
it won &apos;t do . </s>
i &apos;m also going to see what &apos;s in there . </s>
but i do not have a little more curious about it . </s>
yes , kids are curious about the object or should be curious , designers . </s>
i am a <unk> from house , so i &apos;m also looking at myself as well as the subject , of course , how change the curiosity and why are we going to lose and why , and why are we going to reinvent the same amount of failure . </s>
this is a whole series of things that you feel about to be next to the actual <unk> . </s>
when professors are curious about , they will often <unk> in such a <unk> <unk> . </s>
and that &apos;s what i had in the last year . </s>
a <unk> to the subject of a <unk> design . </s>
now , they are going to be wondering why , all the players are the most important players , <unk> <unk> , interacting and so on . </s>
and i think i &apos;m just going to be a little more high , because the things are always going to keep going forward , and there &apos;s a way to look , and you have to look at people , of course , what is really <unk> or intuitive . </s>
and i &apos;ve been able to take myself into the area of the area of the design interface in the so the next generation of human computers in the computer relationship of the human computer in the relationship of the human computer , how to speak the computer <unk> to digital health . </s>
so i got to be engaged in , when is , of course , or <unk> . </s>
maybe even a little bit of a view . </s>
why does that happen ? </s>
so if we look at the development of our society here , just a minute , we move from the third into the fourth <unk> or <unk> . </s>
so , the modern <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
every society is through a <unk> . </s>
at the beginning of language , the language . </s>
that means you have found that you have a common language , you could have a common language , it could have been able to communicate with each other , and has cities , cities and has been trained to <unk> <unk> . </s>
the <unk> was the language , something very , very tough . </s>
so you had to learn , so you can learn , so you can speak about nature , but we &apos;re learning it <unk> and <unk> of course , and they were doing it . </s>
this was the nature of the ancient society and the first form of the abstraction . </s>
this was a <unk> because of course , because of course , the living language in the form of scripture , which is called the <unk> and alive , and then , and i also <unk> it in stone and so forth . </s>
the main thing i &apos;m <unk> and when i &apos;m <unk> , it &apos;s natural one of course , it &apos;s natural than one of them , when there &apos;s one more alive . </s>
but <unk> , then they were <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> . </s>
then the next generation of the generation is still alive . </s>
this is the printing pressure and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and others . </s>
it was a <unk> , <unk> , where the <unk> and others said , &quot; you &apos;re having a big reason if the people are going to read , and that &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
and now we &apos;re going to come to the next generation and the main thing that is so a <unk> , and we &apos;re really in the moment in this <unk> phase in this <unk> period that we &apos;ve been interested in . </s>
the reason we see of course , because we see the one on the one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on . </s>
with the total transparency of transparency , which is thinking about the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> <unk> and no more phenomena , which i want to do is just <unk> , or else phenomena , which is <unk> . </s>
and these two worlds , new and thinking , &quot; well , you think about the other . </s>
and the reason it is when you put the finance , this new society , this new society , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . </s>
but now , not more on the local level , but on a global scale . </s>
we understood that the weather is a liar global . </s>
that &apos;s what the subject is a global . </s>
not when i think i think , when i think ecologically , and the neighbor thinks less , it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
the one means from the local village is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , the most transparency of all transparency , but also the total amount of transparency . </s>
as you know , as you know , who &apos;s been knew what &apos;s happening and what happens and when that happens to the act of this extension of our self , this has been <unk> . </s>
we think we know global warming and more and more than that . </s>
and it &apos;s been happening on the village . </s>
i was busy with trying to think of this , which is actually what &apos;s actually what &apos;s actually what &apos;s actually true , what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what makes the difference for us , so what makes the difference ? </s>
because often , people can &apos;t do it , they can &apos;t do it so anybody with anyone else . </s>
so you have to be with what &apos;s called , and not just admitting it to change that it is different , but it &apos;s also going to be better . </s>
and when i was , of course , and as a intuitive , and how can i take a <unk> of influence to a influence , and i feel so that they &apos;re simply intuitive , so they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just simply using it . </s>
you &apos;ve been busy , even during the course of perception and the <unk> , and the <unk> . </s>
and this is , of course , where you go and say , okay , okay , now , okay , now i &apos;m just seeing the inside of myself . </s>
how about it ? </s>
so , as we work on , we know if we were <unk> ? </s>
and what does it mean , of course , and how how do our channels of perception is how does the cognitive brands processing processing ? </s>
because steve jobs has said to <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
so you have to really look at the detail if i want to make something more or make a <unk> or make a <unk> . </s>
and then , you see , you see , you see , you know , you see a lot of our minds that most of us think we &apos;ve just got five , but it &apos;s certainly a <unk> , because certainly , in the near future , we &apos;re certainly going to have a lot of time , and as an extension of our self . </s>
and , as we were information , how do we take information on the world ? </s>
to say , what is information ? </s>
information is everybody &apos;s opinion . </s>
many use the word , but it doesn &apos;t mean what it then gets to be able to fill detail . </s>
but i have to understand in the nature of the nature , when it &apos;s information to information , when we can information from information , and from information again , i know how to do things like i know , or of course , can make assumptions . </s>
and of course , as a design impact on the perception . </s>
so , we see this , if i &apos;m going to take things like this , i can &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper in the right way , where i don &apos;t know , what is salt and pepper , or i can take a damn &quot; minute . </s>
so very much natural natural in a <unk> , but i see a lot of natural and pepper in the end . </s>
and if i say somebody , give me a salt and pepper or pepper it will be right . </s>
and the left is simply looking at the same way , and i hope to hope that there is no sugar in the salt . </s>
but also , our own perceptions , how do you feel . </s>
for example , this perception of context . </s>
the right circle looks taller than the little , though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just a constant , and yet our perceptions change , and yet our perceptions change in which context we can . </s>
somebody is , what that is ? </s>
<unk> <unk> . </s>
<unk> should be working on . </s>
there &apos;s more of my glasses . </s>
so it &apos;s the <unk> circle . </s>
second , the second circle is starting to be a graphic designer or to be a complete circle . </s>
and then , when i get a <unk> <unk> , you can see it on a <unk> , and we see one unit , circle , circle , circle , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle . </s>
and that &apos;s what you call a <unk> or a <unk> that &apos;s also involved in the perception . </s>
so , the final ones that have been the most part in the first semester to the <unk> . </s>
the closeness of closeness , <unk> of the continuity and so forth . </s>
they often forgot over again . </s>
but that &apos;s a essential important system if you want to make things feel like this . </s>
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting about the one . </s>
sounds very simple , but according to the exciting when you &apos;re doing it , when you get to the closer . </s>
so we &apos;ve got the eyes and now think we see , we see , we see , we see from the front . </s>
that &apos;s wrong . </s>
you see from the back of the day . </s>
she &apos;s <unk> a profound to you , that you see something that you recognize , <unk> circle . </s>
that means we &apos;re only going to see our future , before we see it in our <unk> <unk> to say , okay , okay , okay , but we &apos;re looking at the time , okay , okay , okay . </s>
i &apos;ve been doing so , as i cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see . </s>
then again , it goes back to the fact back . </s>
then , again , again , again , because the back of the <unk> doesn &apos;t go and say , now , but that &apos;s the right thing , you really have to go and get out of what you see . </s>
and then again , it &apos;s actually just been shown to see it . </s>
so , a very simple process , like certain things , and what certain things happen and what we do for the things happen . </s>
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to picture that picture . </s>
and i &apos;ve described exactly the same thing . </s>
now , everybody is trying to see something like this . </s>
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to be . </s>
somebody &apos;s going to be a bit of a clue ? </s>
a <unk> system . </s>
if i saw that that there is a <unk> in it , then you know , it &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
you &apos;ll never forget more , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is . </s>
now , you see the <unk> . </s>
and further him , now you &apos;re always seeing it . </s>
that &apos;s what i &apos;m actually doing , now , even though , that you don &apos;t see any pattern , but i &apos;ve got a <unk> over a second time , but i &apos;ve always been able to see this dog picture of this <unk> picture and again , again . </s>
and this is the projection of the <unk> , <unk> , . </s>
now i know , i know , i see i &apos;m going to see the <unk> . </s>
i see the <unk> . </s>
so , really exciting processes that then , in this , gray , is not actually , but here &apos;s actually the <unk> mass . </s>
somebody are more about ? </s>
long , yes . </s>
that &apos;s our present . </s>
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer . </s>
if i know , i know , i &apos;m three seconds until i &apos;m going to go out in the presence of the <unk> , then i can also be very good in the following by doing three seconds . </s>
he has to digest as a present . </s>
then , it &apos;s going to have to have it in the past and so i can actually take a senior <unk> , for example , if i know this phenomenon . </s>
what &apos;s called <unk> ? </s>
yes , milliseconds . </s>
also , a whole phenomenon . </s>
this is the time of the <unk> in love . </s>
that means , if you know that , you know , you look like a long way , you know how long i see there , who is there , no <unk> for what it is . </s>
and <unk> , a whole <unk> phenomenon . </s>
this is the most powerful thing we have . </s>
that means that the first one has happened in a while we speed things like we &apos;re going to perceive things . </s>
and as we see things like we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of as well as we &apos;re in and as we sort of , we &apos;re sort of as well as accordingly , we can also make it feel like that . </s>
of course , the <unk> is not just the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> , but in the subject of the <unk> . </s>
so , how do you get some things to do . </s>
there is a <unk> <unk> that makes the practical functions of the <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s <unk> where i have to get a lot of , i have to get a grip . </s>
but there &apos;s also symbolic symbolic , why is someone for a little <unk> , where they didn &apos;t get anything so much money on money , though , though , does it not be so handy , although it doesn &apos;t actually be so handy . </s>
there are more than the <unk> , on the <unk> , we &apos;re also looking at the time of course we are . </s>
back to my research , and the subject , what of course , also is <unk> . </s>
so , <unk> means , how can i possibly do a unique goal or how can i get to do a certain goal or how can we make a unique goal of efficiently , efficiently and <unk> . </s>
so , it &apos;s more the norm . </s>
how can i make a little bit of <unk> ? </s>
i can &apos;t do that , or i &apos;m going to do the <unk> manual for that , or i need to make a point of training . </s>
and less <unk> or <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m just looking for the same thing and beautiful , it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better . </s>
you have to understand . </s>
and if you look at the software that we saw , what we &apos;ve seen looking at , you know , why <unk> percent of our current software is really intuitive percent of our software , even though , is really , really , is really , really , is really , really , is really , really , is really much more interesting than any case . </s>
it &apos;s intuitive <unk> doesn &apos;t just get a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if i want to make a new technology in the people . </s>
why ? </s>
because in the process , we &apos;re looking through this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user <unk> , for example , for example , for example , in the middle . </s>
you have to imagine that if you have something of the classical <unk> , five hours and with this new kind of natural software . </s>
that doesn &apos;t mean they probably go home four hours home , but you can then get your employers to you , how he did it with the four hours . </s>
but i want to say it &apos;s a good <unk> , which is a good <unk> , also certain things . </s>
if we look at the corner of the software , there &apos;s so the first <unk> of the law that are very abstract , where you &apos;ve been spending months to deal with these systems , to deal with these systems . </s>
then , the next thing that &apos;s going to be with the <unk> model of disability , or mental model like the software , worked , you have a idea of something that metaphor is going to make a desktop more . </s>
so not more zeros and zeros are the <unk> , but a metaphor <unk> . </s>
it made a lot of times more <unk> , but it &apos;s also a lot better than even better . </s>
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is working with behavior . </s>
so i &apos;m looking at a very much more often than a lot more than the appearance . </s>
that &apos;s a paradigm . </s>
i &apos;ve always shown that this is always <unk> for the success , just the <unk> will be a <unk> . </s>
and then when i got a step further into this video , we have given language in this place , and i can quit by a voice , &quot; language , by <unk> , and the things that needs to be still faster , then i &apos;m still going to go faster and still . </s>
but the reason i &apos;m also going to point out when when will do the things that are actually going to be a lot of things ? </s>
when you &apos;re a little bit , and then i have to come back to my little friend here and show up what &apos;s going on because that &apos;s what does that mean from the point of view , when is really something that &apos;s been happening ? </s>
and this is always a little bit more intuitive , when i think about it , i have to think about it . </s>
so seemingly doesn &apos;t make sense , but it just simply made of it easy to do . </s>
the less i think about it , the one thing it is . </s>
and what does that work for the designers ? </s>
that means when we look at existing <unk> from a different way to transmit the metaphor of something else , for example , i can make the way that i do that . </s>
that means i can do a intuitive , human rights of human health , to a software transfer , and so the software works . </s>
now , of course , the question is , of course , what is really the most potent <unk> of us and now i &apos;m going to tell you . </s>
this is the so-called <unk> . </s>
the use of us and <unk> is a <unk> and it &apos;s like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
so , that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s going to do all the time , but he does it &apos;s <unk> and yes , it &apos;s a instinctively , or whatever . </s>
the model is already <unk> in utero and it &apos;s <unk> , so it &apos;s working on young and old and the old time , and it &apos;s going to be the whole time , without the fact that the model knew . </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> at the time of the <unk> time of us ever to activity in the sleep , so it &apos;s a less number of people &apos;s going to be less than a day . </s>
i can take this mental <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk>
and this is on a higher scale of the <unk> as a low metaphor , which is the same metaphor . </s>
and when i get this , for example , for example , for example , as a result , we &apos;re seeing as a choice , in the detail , in the detail , in the way , in the way , it &apos;s big to me , or shopping or shopping and so on , <unk> means , in the detail , in the way . </s>
i can transmit it all the way . </s>
i &apos;m trying to do this with a <unk> . </s>
everybody has been <unk> . </s>
so , i &apos;m now doing this with the object , can again <unk> , <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ll get the whole pattern , can now be able to filter it from now that i &apos;m going to take all of chocolate . </s>
and then a interface is a bit more natural and very much natural natural . </s>
because i can reach the things like the music can be able to reach and look at me , is more natural to me as a <unk> if you can do this stuff that can make a difference . </s>
let me conclude to a research basis <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i want to conclude , and to give you to conclude , a little bit of need to come to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you for your attention , and please . </s>
i want to give you a certain aspect of curiosity . </s>
the first one , if you become a kid , when baby was tall , it &apos;s a baby , is that they &apos;re allowed to be able to go out and be able to play , the more , and the more , the more , you know , the more , will be able to go back to the way your mind . </s>
and they don &apos;t learn to be . </s>
so , all that are all that are there and they are curious , where did have a characteristic of those who have a characteristic . </s>
i &apos;m now about to get a martian , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
and there &apos;s a central point of view . </s>
and the scale of phosphorus . </s>
<unk> <unk> , a chance . </s>
every day you &apos;ll give you an hour of each other , you have to get you two grams and every day you have to take two grams . </s>
you can &apos;t have teeth . </s>
you can see no energy store . </s>
you can &apos;t have a bone . </s>
we could only be <unk> by the <unk> . </s>
if we don &apos;t take a phosphorus and make them a lot . </s>
and it &apos;s so that we &apos;re actually looking at here with something that &apos;s really important , but it hasn &apos;t been so much . </s>
because everyone talks about energy , but no one speaks about the <unk> . </s>
the <unk> is a lot of critical . </s>
we depend on two countries . </s>
we only have two years and now that &apos;s going through the <unk> world , the environment are much more uranium in the environment than all of the <unk> . </s>
in the last 20 years , <unk> <unk> has been produced by our fields in germany . </s>
and that &apos;s what we do all . </s>
it makes leukemia children . </s>
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little bit less harmful . </s>
so , for example , <unk> , <unk> , less expensive . </s>
it makes less expensive . </s>
environment can be less energy . </s>
it &apos;s not protection . </s>
this is like i would say , if i could say , &quot; <unk> your child , just three times a rather than just three times . </s>
this is just a little less habitat . </s>
if we think about the <unk> until the <unk> , our home will be more likely to <unk> our entire life or a <unk> . </s>
so that &apos;s why the <unk> <unk> to think . </s>
and the most important thing is to us , as a function of the ground . </s>
in the ground , over a half percent of the <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re building the moment of corn and losing over the course of <unk> manure per acre , or on the <unk> , or <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re losing losing the ground around the ground , and it &apos;s about the new emerging . </s>
we can take away the <unk> ratio . </s>
and everything is very frightening , or content . </s>
in <unk> , for instance , at the most <unk> percent of the fish &apos;s voted . </s>
and because we are going to be older , the <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s sort of <unk> in the <unk> . </s>
yes ? </s>
a baby needs about a <unk> . </s>
we could use it to be 10 percent , but what does it matter ? </s>
this is going to be a second . </s>
that &apos;s a whole <unk> . </s>
so the question is , how do we go to this ? </s>
here &apos;s the proof of proof that men are not pigs . </s>
i want to tell you . </s>
because the phosphorus is going to be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> . </s>
people are talking about the urine . </s>
yes . </s>
so that &apos;s what they can &apos;t be pigs . </s>
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening , right ? </s>
traditionally , we think we &apos;re too many of the world . </s>
and if you say people who exist when you say people , if you say that if you &apos;re not there , you don &apos;t get to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and so somebody like al gore , one of our big hero , there is nothing more than the human population . </s>
in israel , if you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;ll see the earth . </s>
here &apos;s what you say , the more you get more . </s>
yes . </s>
the first question is we really are a lot of ? </s>
if you look at ants , the weight of ants on earth , the ants on the earth , the ants on the earth . </s>
i could also say goodbye , but in the united states , nobody is going to see in the united states , in the way that they are . </s>
that means the ants are much more than us . </s>
and because they physically physically work much tougher than we and because they only three months live in the energy , in the energy consumption of the human brain . </s>
that means we &apos;re not too stupid , so we &apos;re too stupid , yes ? </s>
and where you really wanted to do that , and we really wanted to do what we really wanted and how sad we are at the earth &apos;s , you can see that the program is a program until 20 , to be here , right ? </s>
you can only be able to be able to be able to be able to do if you don &apos;t exist ? </s>
the only chance of opportunity . </s>
have you seen a tree ? </s>
yes ? </s>
one ? </s>
that means our whole intelligence means that we &apos;re going to be a trees , yes ? </s>
yes ? </s>
no tree is <unk> . </s>
fortunately , yes , it &apos;s a way ? </s>
there is no <unk> to trees . </s>
there are still in the <unk> system , in the <unk> . </s>
and you &apos;ve heard about a little bit of a <unk> trees ? </s>
that means all our intelligence means that we &apos;re going to be a trees . </s>
and where you see , even though , in something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> , don &apos;t allow our own <unk> . </s>
every year we lose three million tons of tons of phosphorus to the really <unk> . </s>
and so we &apos;re too many . </s>
it &apos;s about that . </s>
that means we feel like this . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how they all embrace , the allow that allow our own <unk> . </s>
isn &apos;t that ? </s>
that &apos;s where we are . </s>
it &apos;s certainly very much about it , which is <unk> , which is <unk> . </s>
but where are we useful ? </s>
we &apos;re trying to minimize ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that &apos;s useful . </s>
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s not knowing , yes ? </s>
<unk> ? </s>
they can only have <unk> if they don &apos;t get there . </s>
even if you &apos;d have the shooting , you &apos;d get to get away . </s>
so you can &apos;t solve it . </s>
we can do it differently . </s>
we can take our nutrients . </s>
we &apos;re doing in brazil agriculture in brazil where we get the nutrients . </s>
in fact , we can <unk> this way in agriculture , and we can <unk> nutrients in agriculture . </s>
we &apos;re doing this in china , where we &apos;re seeing right now the one of those things that take you right now . </s>
in china &apos;s called a <unk> today , which is a <unk> , okay ? </s>
and in our western world , we were always dumb to be our nutrients . </s>
that means that means the whole western <unk> <unk> by that city , but never have been the farmers ever since . </s>
and so on the cities , the cities are getting more growing , because the farmers in the city and cities would keep track . </s>
all of the western rich rich are always expanding , until they haven &apos;t done more than they and then they &apos;re <unk> . </s>
yes ? </s>
it was different . </s>
you &apos;ve got <unk> civilization over the age of ages , because you &apos;re always able to get the nutrients . </s>
even today , when you &apos;re in china , you &apos;re going to be in china to the food that they stay off as long as they stay off as long as they stay away from the toilet . </s>
because it &apos;s too big , and the nutrients is doing . </s>
you have to eat them , not to <unk> , not to <unk> . </s>
that means you can see the internet , how to the nutrients . </s>
so this is a nice thing that is when you do that , so agriculture does , and so that &apos;s the <unk> , and the plant to <unk> , on a hectare of soil , and the plant for the plant and <unk> and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables . </s>
and the great thing is that the <unk> <unk> in favelas , in favelas , in favelas . </s>
so we don &apos;t have to control people &apos;s bad . </s>
we can be able to be good at . </s>
this is , of course , but the sound carry themselves . </s>
it &apos;s clean water . </s>
and they are so designed by design that we may have just a farmer . </s>
that means the <unk> gets to go back . </s>
and none of these facilities we &apos;ve been built over <unk> now in the past 20 years , none of these <unk> has ever been from that <unk> . </s>
they could easily easily be a liter of <unk> <unk> , and then it would be <unk> . </s>
not instead . </s>
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be very poor . </s>
we can be able to be good at . </s>
we have to get phosphorus phosphorus . </s>
and by the way , if you want to write what they want to do , they write in germany , and by the way all of the <unk> is the <unk> . </s>
unfortunately , the not in <unk> , but maybe you can &apos;t even help the <unk> website . </s>
because the <unk> plant may be the phosphorus . </s>
and the needs to come back . </s>
we see that phosphorus is really critical . </s>
and we see it &apos;s actually being done . </s>
we &apos;ve been studying over three years now . </s>
the government has explains the first country to be the first country in the world , which is <unk> . </s>
but we need to have the total . </s>
you know , there are two countries that are almost more likely to control 70 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> . </s>
there is opec a bunch of <unk> . </s>
these are <unk> countries that could control 40 percent of the brain stem cells . </s>
and we &apos;ll replace replace other people . </s>
but the phosphorus is not going to replace . </s>
it &apos;s not about being a little less bad to do it , but it &apos;s about to do something really right . </s>
and especially to ask , what the right thing is . </s>
it means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency . </s>
in holland , you know , of course , because in holland is the country on the land . </s>
yes ? </s>
imagine if you &apos;re sad your wife &apos;s sad if you have <unk> , and they come together with the other <unk> . </s>
totally <unk> . </s>
but it &apos;s very effective , yes ? </s>
or take a <unk> . </s>
one woman eats in germany , about six billion years of yours during their lives . </s>
it &apos;s doing . </s>
this is not exactly the right now because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to be done . </s>
but a <unk> , even at that lighting , i can tell you , is absolutely fine , but it &apos;s all effective , but it &apos;s effective and more and effective , yes ? </s>
a whole life is not efficient . </s>
it doesn &apos;t really matter , but it &apos;s efficiency . </s>
to ask what &apos;s right ? </s>
not , the <unk> still gets a little better too , and it makes them all the time and it &apos;s getting <unk> and <unk> the whole materials for the dollar , but first time of how to lose ? </s>
now , you know , i think , in a way . </s>
yes ? </s>
if i &apos;m a dinner party and say , well , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water . </s>
wonderful ? </s>
this is a efficient . </s>
all of which is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient . </s>
if you put in somebody , efficiently ? </s>
yes ? </s>
that means everything counts , is not about to save it , to reduce avoid . </s>
all of the sudden <unk> . </s>
we tell people , oh , you guys don &apos;t have a green space in the south . </s>
no , the main thing is that we &apos;re right ? </s>
each spot where you &apos;re <unk> , from , yes , you can get back to <unk> . </s>
but there &apos;s the wrong thing . </s>
if you <unk> the wrong thing , you have a <unk> . </s>
in the north , we think of north korea . </s>
there is anyone <unk> . </s>
if you run , it &apos;s a <unk> footprint . </s>
because the soil will die and the water will die and the water is going to be gone . </s>
if you &apos;re in italy , it means that the water &apos;s longer in the meadow is still in the meadow . </s>
so , it &apos;s about to create a big footprint . </s>
not <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re going to say , germany , it &apos;s actually . </s>
yes ? </s>
but when i was asked to question , how about her wife ? </s>
what do you say ? </s>
you &apos;re going to be able to go . </s>
i say , <unk> <unk> , yes , like ? </s>
that &apos;s just the minimum . </s>
so no , we &apos;re not going to avoid . </s>
everybody &apos;s <unk> . </s>
and it &apos;s a really scary when you see in italy , how people are looking at the <unk> sound of the car , the car . </s>
because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> process . </s>
it &apos;s kind of scary from <unk> , yes , right ? </s>
you can show me . </s>
but with the right design , please . </s>
we have a <unk> designed that &apos;s been linked to the other . </s>
you can go to where they go and stand up . </s>
in two hours , they &apos;re going to go around everywhere . </s>
and they &apos;re contains <unk> by rare plants , so that it &apos;s the ultimate to biodiversity . </s>
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful . </s>
so it &apos;s two cycles . </s>
not all of course , is it . </s>
a tv or a washing machine , they use it only that they don &apos;t use . </s>
just the things that <unk> <unk> , how <unk> how to go , how <unk> that they go in biological systems . </s>
things that are only used to go , go into technical systems . </s>
but today , we &apos;re talking about biological systems . </s>
yes ? </s>
for example , yes , it &apos;s a <unk> ? </s>
very direct , not for the company , and it &apos;s not for the company <unk> by the company , but for that , they can help this company to make these products . </s>
because we don &apos;t do things anymore . </s>
yes ? </s>
so , if i &apos;m <unk> , and say , you know , you &apos;re free of <unk> , you &apos;re going to get it . </s>
no , we &apos;ll see what &apos;s in there . </s>
positive . </s>
so not like <unk> . </s>
not even in the middle . </s>
it &apos;s useful . </s>
these are the first shoes that they can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and the rubber in the middle of the brain can go in , yes ? </s>
it &apos;s <unk> . </s>
and if we do , it &apos;s like , it does us , of course , for nike , for nike and <unk> and <unk> and whole textile . </s>
and this is half of all the <unk> world , which is caused by the textile industry . </s>
so , you know , you &apos;re asking for people to come up with people . </s>
hey , <unk> , power is your really serious ? </s>
because the lesson now is twice the <unk> settlement . </s>
and i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s really <unk> . </s>
so , you know , you &apos;re looking at me . </s>
but it &apos;s about . </s>
yes . </s>
what &apos;s been demonstrated by the time . </s>
that &apos;s what goes . </s>
we can do things now that you can do when you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can be biological . </s>
technical activity , it &apos;s just as . </s>
there is a direct <unk> . </s>
this is the first ecological that &apos;s made of the <unk> , which is made in the circulation . </s>
also , so that you can browse the things in any store , you can get things . </s>
when you come to the next , right ? </s>
remember , for the sake of you , remember ? </s>
when it &apos;s trash . </s>
all over the time , the <unk> . </s>
in the countries where people get to the money . </s>
it &apos;s been around on the <unk> , but also , in the landscape , yes , it &apos;s the landscape of the landscape ? </s>
if we change the plastics , so that he can go into biological systems , if we can change the vibrational change , you can back to a baby , then you can back with a baby in israel or tunisia . </s>
yes ? </s>
if you take this paper , you <unk> , it &apos;s sterilized , it &apos;s sterilized , and the powder take to the disease . </s>
that &apos;s the baby &apos;s been <unk> for the whole life , it &apos;s already beginning to start . </s>
so we don &apos;t need <unk> , we can be <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
yes , you know , in a way . </s>
yes ? </s>
we can do that . </s>
we can also invent anything . </s>
i started to have a institute . </s>
but meanwhile , there &apos;s lots of people in and you can get all the other . </s>
there &apos;s a extra mix of a <unk> , <unk> , where anybody can go . </s>
so no longer save , we eat , no , no <unk> , but intelligent waste waste . </s>
do you make the curious ? </s>
thank you . </s>
the work of the <unk> . </s>
music was . </s>
so in my talk , i was written by my talk as a <unk> , so i was lying in english , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> music . </s>
you know , you know , as a translator word for the text in the text of words , but also the deeper sense of words and understanding the deeper sense of words and protein understand the words and <unk> . </s>
so , from the germans to translate from english , you can make more , you know , you know , it &apos;s about poetry or anything about it . </s>
very , it &apos;s very , very , very , what we did with our <unk> . </s>
when a <unk> came from a <unk> , i was just going to go up to the world . </s>
you know , you think that the central policy flows in the grades has been done , what he has been left . </s>
in fact , the grades and <unk> , and <unk> . </s>
these grades are about equivalently right or <unk> , like a verbal period when it &apos;s a verbal very precise , description of the landscape , description of a landscape . </s>
because in this <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the flowers not to smell the level of the <unk> , not to feel like the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
that means the interpreter has to take this <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
today , i want to tell you what i could do , so <unk> , even in a verbal language . </s>
so basically , basically , basically , basically . </s>
so i prefer to get it to the whole thing rather than all the time i &apos;d been talking to the first time , because i have to translate the english &apos;s translation of translation . </s>
so the problem works for me as a way of spoken language . </s>
the <unk> notes have the function of a <unk> . </s>
so , it doesn &apos;t mean , just reading grades reading , and the way to the piano to a traffic jam on a <unk> . </s>
that would be only the letters that you learn . </s>
the sense of the letters , you know , if you can get the language . </s>
so , in fact , you need to be interested in the learning of the music for the world . </s>
there is also then <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , just like you &apos;re going to understand it , or you can see , to the musical rate . </s>
the work of the <unk> begins to the one . </s>
after you first , a piece of <unk> , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to lose one of the genesis of the composition of the composition of the composition . </s>
you &apos;re using the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
you read in the sky , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words of the composer self . </s>
you &apos;ve studied the writings that he had before and he has been done . </s>
you can compare to . </s>
the <unk> , it &apos;s too . </s>
how did he get it ? </s>
how were his <unk> and politics of politics ? </s>
that &apos;s all the way me . </s>
you think about this time in doing the way , looking at the example of the things that are looking at pictures or literature . </s>
but also , you know , as a result , you know , as an urban knowledge , to the composers that you &apos;re playing with , and it &apos;s lying to a very lighter and feel a way to feel it in <unk> and feel a way of feeling . </s>
the more complex will always be alive , with the one in the heart . </s>
and to write the piece that &apos;s a piece more and more and more and more and personal concerns . </s>
now , the notes of all others as a very precise record of the composers of the composers , but only a framework that i &apos;m going to take this scaffold with meaning and meaning . </s>
i say to my own , what was going on in this scaffolding . </s>
i &apos;m using games , what they could have to do . </s>
now for me , and for the composers , and what you might now mean for him today . </s>
everybody tone , every phrase gets to get a sense of that because i &apos;m reminded it myself from my personal personal <unk> . </s>
it has to be in my mind and now <unk> , otherwise i can &apos;t convince that that &apos;s my audiences &apos;s going to be my mind . </s>
it &apos;s always a very ambitious colony , when i can have the experience that i have so long in advance , the piece that i see so long . </s>
as you can see a happy new day over again , even though , when we talk with the same life of life , and , in the same way , i &apos;m going to do the same piece of work that &apos;s going to be back to new . </s>
i &apos;m a day , a day , the seasons , my pulse is going to be a day , in a <unk> , takes it back to a <unk> area that the sound would be back to home . </s>
i take the audience of the audience , i &apos;ll see it , in fact , <unk> . </s>
all of the influences , and all the influences that the way that the composition is , with the composition of the composition . </s>
so wonderful is even though i &apos;m going to be on stage at stage at stage , and we have the same wavelength . </s>
and then the same thing like in a good , <unk> conversation . </s>
you get a new idea and <unk> this answered , and i will answer this one answer with a response . </s>
it &apos;s exciting , because things that we don &apos;t have to be <unk> and what you can &apos;t be able to do . </s>
it makes you big fun to do that , and they like the audience , and they have the audience to have the music . </s>
so every concert of the concert . </s>
i &apos;m never going to play more like this moment . </s>
i can &apos;t play a way to go in 20 years . </s>
i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to be on my palette of <unk> , much more holistic and emotions have been today . </s>
i &apos;m going to have some <unk> even , but for a new <unk> . </s>
so , for example , it &apos;s a nice example . </s>
it was on a <unk> basis of <unk> old teacher in my beloved teacher in my beloved teacher , professor <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of <unk> in <unk> . </s>
unfortunately , i was still too young , so he was <unk> when i finally started studying . </s>
but i was the great fortune , it was very early , with <unk> , so with some of my kids , and so i was so on to my <unk> . </s>
i was 17 , when i was 17 on a his first visit , and i was playing the last four years of <unk> , a <unk> . </s>
he wondered what the introduction of this <unk> was . </s>
that &apos;s a <unk> fraction of the things . </s>
and i said , well , i was talking . </s>
he was so , it &apos;s like , &quot; well , &quot; it was like this ? </s>
it has to be the <unk> . </s>
because for me , you know , &quot; it means . </s>
he was talking about a half . </s>
well , with 17 , you &apos;ve got dreams , but no real memories . </s>
i &apos;m a piece of play today , and it &apos;s got to be more interested in me , even though it has changed for me , although no one has changed . </s>
every time i &apos;m going to read something new , i &apos;ll read something new . </s>
example , an example from a different perspective . it has the <unk> <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> light bulbs , in <unk> light . </s>
he has <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as they saw in this moment on it . </s>
his personal <unk> of <unk> . </s>
the <unk> interpretation of a portion of a portion . </s>
meanwhile , i was very much more than a <unk> period when he wrote the piece . </s>
he was only <unk> years . </s>
and it &apos;s very important to see in the grades , even though i mean , you can see it . </s>
to keep <unk> , right with the composers . </s>
because the notes are the only connection . </s>
especially when he died , it &apos;s been passed . </s>
now , how do you talk to the music ? </s>
i said yes , you need to take care of the world as well . </s>
often , the <unk> is so you learn that you &apos;re just reading the notes . </s>
you learn how to do the first thing before you just write a word . </s>
you learn to find the notes on the instrument . </s>
if you were all walking around and you &apos;re looking like it , come in the grades of the grades , then sounds like music . </s>
when that &apos;s the <unk> , the students &apos;s <unk> piece of the robot . </s>
and he barely talk about interpretation in the <unk> . </s>
all right , there &apos;s a quick piece of a piece of a piece of fast . </s>
<unk> , slow . </s>
according to the and <unk> , and b , et . </s>
most of you here . </s>
but even though you put this , there &apos;s still something that &apos;s just happening . </s>
and still not interpretation of the interpretation . </s>
i &apos;m a little bit of wonder . </s>
i wonder that you often have something quite a little bit more interesting . </s>
namely , that &apos;s what music is to do with your musical instrument and feel so they should feel like they should have been . </s>
that &apos;s singing . </s>
a child who didn &apos;t learn about because it &apos;s not <unk> , it won &apos;t be done by itself . </s>
this is like <unk> . </s>
it is essential to have its own experiences and the idea of music , it &apos;s about one another way to get to sound about a tool , so to get a tool to get to sound . </s>
people who never have been hearing , never have been their own body , as it is to form a tone . </s>
one of the phrase with his own breath . </s>
the enemy is the extension of our bodies . </s>
and the singing of the singing , we have hands and feet to dance . </s>
so the <unk> is the sequel of my fingers . </s>
the melody is from the dance and the rhythm from the dance . </s>
the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> . </s>
you don &apos;t need to make more than even a boring thing that &apos;s going to be a boring . </s>
no more required to whistle , or singing , singing , singing . </s>
every single music will be <unk> when you &apos;re looking at music , you &apos;ll see it with music <unk> . </s>
well , there are some people among you , but what if i can &apos;t be singing , but what if i can &apos;t be singing ? </s>
i &apos;m asking you , you can &apos;t sing , a doctor because you can &apos;t be singing , you can &apos;t be singing ? </s>
or b , because they learned not to singing ? </s>
and at least it &apos;s not too late to find out whether they can &apos;t be able to learn whether they can &apos;t be able to learn how to the <unk> muscles . </s>
that &apos;s what you can train . </s>
or c , because you &apos;ve got to have <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m a question like <unk> , this diagnosis ? </s>
have you have a <unk> or <unk> for it to be beautiful , how to do it today ? </s>
or d , she doesn &apos;t seem to have a music and you want to do it . </s>
but what i &apos;d like to do is because music is a beautiful thing , <unk> thing . </s>
but maybe you can even <unk> it . </s>
well , you can see all the time to be a <unk> candidate . </s>
but you don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music . </s>
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad . </s>
and i thought , but surely , surely , you can tell if it &apos;s not a like you &apos;re like you &apos;re like , or not . </s>
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook , because i can &apos;t cook . </s>
so , they don &apos;t eat food , just because they can &apos;t cook . </s>
so they don &apos;t have to be able to classical music because they don &apos;t play a tool . </s>
listen to consciously , you know , whether it &apos;s not a <unk> . </s>
whether the music is to be <unk> . </s>
tell you what you feel . </s>
with the time , they also want to go and want to do something more , or taste even out of the difference . </s>
why do i have to be done by my audience that it &apos;s also actively actively ? </s>
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate . </s>
one of the things you never look at , has no force . </s>
the food that &apos;s eating from a chef or a chef , has been eaten by a chef , not just a <unk> or a <unk> . </s>
so , you know , if a music is played , it &apos;s a music playing . </s>
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> . </s>
if you hear a environment where the adults are active or at least active music , a child , a child , then , it &apos;s easy for a <unk> , which color ? </s>
can you play in blue ? </s>
and the kid plays a <unk> , rather than a red , rather than a red form of a blue . </s>
and this is not a way to do . </s>
it was then the first way of an expression of conduct . </s>
so the first step is to a interpretation . </s>
and what happens when you play a piece of play , which is a hundred , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> ago , or <unk> ago . </s>
meanwhile , the instruments of <unk> . </s>
there was a time of the time as a <unk> . </s>
it was not yet fiction . </s>
i think the stream was psyched when he was the <unk> of the world &apos;s modern <unk> . </s>
i can now see the <unk> that the stream has had its wings to sound , which is a <unk> <unk> . </s>
also , from beethoven , he heard more than he was deaf . </s>
today , a modern orchestra , everything that had a orchestra of playing with a <unk> affair . </s>
so the composers of us are <unk> <unk> for the pieces of the pieces of <unk> <unk> . </s>
so they &apos;ll just have been going on in the spirit . </s>
and also , what they &apos;re thinking about today . </s>
or what i think they could do today because what they were thinking . </s>
thank you . </s>
you know , what &apos;s envy ? </s>
in fact , there were a lot of ? </s>
and how did that ? </s>
he &apos;ll take a look . </s>
i mean , he &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
when i come to my little v , and i &apos;m looking at what &apos;s going on , i &apos;m going to see this feeling . </s>
i mean , through the head of the head . </s>
i say , <unk> , what &apos;s going to be so close to the great ? </s>
this is already starting to be in the first year of his <unk> . </s>
and they &apos;re doing a lot less than me . </s>
why i have to afford to the n of little car ? </s>
and then i &apos;m immediately , that &apos;s unfair . </s>
it &apos;s the justice system . </s>
and like i &apos;m saying the word is a sense of what i say . </s>
our organism has a great way to bring these spaces of connection to the <unk> . </s>
you can try and try like revenge or <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or . </s>
i want to share with this mechanism today , or a few more , what is probably familiar with . </s>
the mechanism is from the lie . </s>
but think about the lie , as you may say you may have heard when people say , nobody , nobody has been around . </s>
and then <unk> , he gave them the lens of <unk> . </s>
and at the end of a lie , you see that liars itself doesn &apos;t believe . </s>
it &apos;s actually what he has different from the mind in mind . </s>
he &apos;s just not himself himself . </s>
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , i &apos;m talking about that they &apos;re going to deceive with this . </s>
they need to preserve this one , to preserve a little more <unk> to preserve . </s>
they can make less easy , yes , <unk> , even though they &apos;re going to make a difference . </s>
they need time . </s>
from this time , a anecdote that may be familiar . </s>
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman &apos;s <unk> . </s>
this woman has got a little bit of a similar portrait , the portrait of her -- the portrait . </s>
picasso just wait . </s>
it &apos;s always going to be a bit . </s>
and at that point , and if you laugh , you realize how important is this one , and how much time you need to do something about what artists can us . </s>
because artist have a <unk> ratio . </s>
artist divide them something with them , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when they &apos;re just the mirror . </s>
the artist divide you in a portrait of a portrait of a portrait , which is going to look at that same thing as you see that the informal and look back again . </s>
then , the awkward of the sense of that may be , you know , actually , it &apos;s not a similar thing . </s>
so here they have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to use our <unk> . </s>
and not only in art , in the <unk> , in the mythology of the mythology in mythology in the mythology of stories in the mythology . </s>
you may know this idea of the lady that every morning in the mirror and the <unk> looked at who &apos;s most beautiful ? </s>
one day , this is a <unk> , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
and so on , it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s going to continue . </s>
and you know how much hostility , how much hostility from this true , even though can &apos;t lie out of this true , from that true . </s>
but we should just make a <unk> that you can &apos;t say , there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else somewhere else . </s>
here &apos;s what we &apos;ve done under <unk> <unk> , always <unk> , always <unk> . </s>
we need this <unk> , which is the deception of the illusion that we don &apos;t really want to be . </s>
we &apos;re not just in the art of art , in the <unk> , but also in the science of great . </s>
and there is this story of the <unk> of <unk> . </s>
she heard about charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of the origin . </s>
that the human being , the monkeys should be <unk> and , yes , it &apos;s a common ancestry between humans and monkeys . </s>
and then she ran her to her husband and said , &quot; that &apos;s not true what charles &apos;s going to write . </s>
human human ancestor is to be <unk> or a common ancestry . </s>
no , no , it &apos;s not . </s>
and when it &apos;s true , we need to prevent that people are going to have the people in it . </s>
why do we stop that people are going to have something like it ? </s>
because we can &apos;t live without this <unk> . </s>
because we &apos;re self-deception to this sense of great , great , which is , in addition to the highest nature of a <unk> , from the <unk> , of something like a organism , and otherwise the things that is even a stone , and what about things that is for us . </s>
so we can &apos;t see this stuff . </s>
we need to prevent people that people are like , but when they are , they are true . </s>
so you can see how slowly this mechanism and what the trace look like , the <unk> look at something else , and what he &apos;s going to do is that the other thing i want to give you a more <unk> . </s>
one particularly story about how i mean . </s>
my wife told me . </s>
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher told , and she told me about one of a students . </s>
a <unk> student . </s>
she likes him to be a <unk> for the sincerity . </s>
and she asked him what &apos;s going to be ? </s>
and he says , i &apos;m at the fire . </s>
and because i &apos;m in the fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things . </s>
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> about this , because it &apos;s not true . </s>
i told you , always , when a human being in a moral program was the <unk> because we &apos;re trying to replace it through the <unk> . </s>
do you know the sentence . </s>
although i &apos;m at the fire , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> things . </s>
and they feel like the real truth of the present . </s>
so a little <unk> , which is not the <unk> <unk> . </s>
the interested care about <unk> . </s>
but there &apos;s no charities that we can take out of the way we learn from where you learn fire , how to do fire . </s>
there is only the <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s got a lot of . </s>
and <unk> , you also say , well , also , you &apos;d like to take a bond somewhere and sit down when the fires was liberated . </s>
no , it &apos;s just a lot better when we show that we &apos;re having the numbers to create the dangers that are the dangers that are only going to be fires when they lay fire fire . </s>
and they have this little mechanism . </s>
this <unk> suggests that in the <unk> of the <unk> already , that he &apos;s actually the fire , that he &apos;s actually not loud loud . </s>
and here you have this <unk> relationship between the unconscious and the <unk> , the immediately of which they can do about it , and the things that you know , and the things that you know , and the things that you can do , and so they can &apos;t sound much better for them and other objectives . </s>
so , just as we get to the words of the political natural systems , again , again , again . </s>
actually , we know that something else is . </s>
but we know if we are , the social networking is very sensitive . </s>
we can &apos;t do that . </s>
it &apos;s impossible to get things in a society that work to present . </s>
so i want to share with you in my own position . </s>
according to what logic , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the most , from the very well that they actually know is to spread out . </s>
so , i want to give you two examples of maybe even three examples . </s>
the first example of you know , what many of you know , and some of you don &apos;t know about it , all of you don &apos;t need to use at all . </s>
i mean , my soul . </s>
what &apos;s the soul ? </s>
the soul is so much tougher for about the length . </s>
it &apos;s something that is not about to be <unk> , the ultimate nature . </s>
and if you have people who are belief that causes the gulf of the gulf , they &apos;re having a soul , or you can tell you that the soul that you have to be a life , and you can tell that the soul that you &apos;ve been talking about , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , yes , yes ,
and of course , from that soul , you know , that somehow you see in this <unk> nature in this <unk> nature , <unk> , the <unk> , the death rate . </s>
and when that <unk> <unk> , over the people , he &apos;s been <unk> with spirit , with spirit , with spirit , who can only live with my soul , yes . </s>
and then he can <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul are . </s>
so she &apos;s supposed to be there . </s>
so we &apos;re going to be able to think about what &apos;s going to be your life . </s>
and if you have this premise , you know , you know , you know , you know , the logic that we experience this happiness , through a lie . </s>
because now , you can apply a <unk> . </s>
you know , you know , you know , from the school . </s>
this is a <unk> that &apos;s logic that &apos;s been logic . </s>
this is the most part in my talk . </s>
you know , you need something , but also the willingness to lying . </s>
and so lying is just lying that they can just go wrong . </s>
in this <unk> , three sentences . </s>
the first sentence , <unk> , there are no soul . </s>
the second sentence , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul . </s>
now there &apos;s a third sentence . </s>
i &apos;ve got him . </s>
a third of the sentence that immediately had a strong sense of a soul . </s>
the people say who no soul is dead and can &apos;t be able to say anything . </s>
and here &apos;s it &apos;s already . </s>
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk , the <unk> talk . </s>
you can see it immediately . </s>
the first two phrases that are really good . </s>
i can say anything . </s>
the logic does not have a potential about reality . </s>
i can say , the <unk> is a man . </s>
and when i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man . </s>
if i don &apos;t quite have a right , then the <unk> is not a man . </s>
logic does not make a message about what &apos;s true . </s>
i mean , all of you . </s>
but the key thing is when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just a little bit . </s>
so if <unk> says there are no soul . </s>
second , he has no soul . </s>
these things are logical . </s>
and now we can tell our consciousness , you can do something . </s>
it &apos;s not a third sentence that &apos;s not the first one sentence with the first two sentences , and the way that would be proved the opposite of the first sentence and has been accepted . </s>
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not . </s>
but with this logic that it &apos;s simply using two sentences that have two sentences are correctly , and a third <unk> that looks like he had to do something about it , so we can save our lives . </s>
so we &apos;re doing it as if it &apos;s not possible without a soul . </s>
and we &apos;re very happy about it . </s>
we can actually do this stuff on different examples . </s>
in the present , we have a very simple example of modern , which is always the <unk> thing . </s>
and so , you have to have another <unk> topic , a <unk> of the philosophy , the <unk> of the philosophy . </s>
so , that we go back to the <unk> century . </s>
there was a real scholars who was a <unk> , and after the <unk> <unk> . </s>
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s made of nature . </s>
it hasn &apos;t been the soul . </s>
that &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
and when you see the exact age in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he <unk> . </s>
because he &apos;s not going to go to first . </s>
so he &apos;s right in the middle . </s>
so , the <unk> is <unk> . </s>
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s nothing intrinsically happening . </s>
only when you get another example , so if you make a change larger , it doesn &apos;t take a steering wheel , and then it doesn &apos;t take care of reason and nothing . </s>
automatically he walks to the right thought . </s>
if you have this idea that you &apos;re going to be able to get into nature , <unk> , from larger and the larger pile that you immediately have a instantly , and then you quickly feeling that there must be a little bit like a complete space . </s>
and if we &apos;re in <unk> , we remember in the middle of the <unk> , then i remember the <unk> for the <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s a scholars that is called the wolf <unk> , and from him to say sometimes , wolf , wolf there are no <unk> . </s>
now we can add back to the second set of <unk> , and say if they &apos;re right , he didn &apos;t have a <unk> . </s>
these phrases are absolutely logical and correct . </s>
and what we &apos;re now going to read almost every year in the daily reading , that &apos;s what they find in this third . </s>
the looks like this , who no <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , but also , for his action and claims and become responsible , and he &apos;s therefore <unk> . </s>
again , it &apos;s again . </s>
actually , you have to prove it like a <unk> basis . </s>
but the logic of deception is what we want to do , as if the first sentence from the sun &apos;s wrong without a lot of <unk> evidence . </s>
and now , you can just want to do anything if you want to test anything , and especially when you want to do people happy , the audacity to give people happy to the <unk> . </s>
and then you know , for instance , if you meet people you , you can tell you , there are no <unk> . </s>
and please use it to the german word for <unk> , which is called the <unk> . </s>
they don &apos;t think that would be a little political <unk> . </s>
they say there &apos;s no <unk> . </s>
immediately , they will be one of the things that there is about to take these <unk> , you can &apos;t prove . </s>
and they have a problem . </s>
because as you have been engaged with it , they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , is the man &apos;s happy . </s>
he &apos;s very happy about it . </s>
because he &apos;s having a <unk> , on the he &apos;s not going to be the case . </s>
actually , this is not a person &apos;s interested in it . </s>
he &apos;s just interested in the need of themselves to prove the need to prove that there &apos;s no <unk> . </s>
so , in the shift of the shift , the <unk> of the lie is the <unk> of the lie . </s>
and once again , if you have a way to feel that this <unk> leads to other people , you know , because they &apos;re going to remember other than that they do in that way , if you don &apos;t remember that way . </s>
thank you for your attention . </s>
yes , good afternoon . </s>
i &apos;m allowed to speak a <unk> , whether i can mention them . </s>
she &apos;s one of the most exciting event of this great event and asked me if i &apos;m wondering here , and my idea is a talk . </s>
i have to say , you know , it was yes , it was a hard to talk about it . </s>
and i may be my favorite example of what i &apos;m trying to do . </s>
but it &apos;s natural for many ideas . </s>
i &apos;m looking for a little bit of nice girls , i probably have to study the generation that &apos;s bad for this bad image of this bad image because i &apos;ve been <unk> , and today , i think , the <unk> , is it . </s>
and i got it in the &apos; 50s , i was going to berlin , because i wanted to go to berlin , and that was in <unk> . </s>
there was the <unk> <unk> . </s>
and the news was all <unk> , also the <unk> <unk> . </s>
the hot city is <unk> . </s>
because a good good scientist , either great cars , or <unk> . </s>
but what sort of the <unk> like mcdonald &apos;s <unk> watts , from the kind of hundred watts , that was a toy . </s>
and in berlin , it was a <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m grateful grateful that he has returned to the word again because after the <unk> , you didn &apos;t use the word because it was bad . </s>
but in the &apos; 60s , i don &apos;t have the way . </s>
and there was a little bit that it was <unk> <unk> and one of them sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you &apos;re doing the evil . </s>
and the <unk> , but it was meant <unk> and it was meant and everything , and i started in the &apos; 80s . </s>
and yes , much of what &apos;s been told about today , but it was very , very , very much because many beautiful jobs are doing that i &apos;ve been working . </s>
i worked in the long way that it was <unk> . </s>
we were 20 people . </s>
if one was said , the <unk> that has a full <unk> , which has a completely <unk> thing , i was very interested in my own <unk> , because all my colleagues my father had always been a <unk> thing , you have to have the money to <unk> your window to your window at your child . </s>
it &apos;s been done with it . </s>
and that was really , very <unk> and you get it into the way that we asked myself , a picture of the picture , where i asked myself , a picture of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the real thing . </s>
and i got to <unk> , and then we have a <unk> <unk> , and then we got cofounder friends , the company <unk> , which then <unk> together with the <unk> <unk> of the world . </s>
one <unk> , but also , of course , we have been , of course , the problem of growing up , and we have <unk> , a small group , we have a small group , we &apos;re talking about what &apos;s the idea that we &apos;re talking about , that &apos;s the <unk> , we &apos;re talking about , we &apos;re talking about a lot of the things
and i &apos;m a project i &apos;d like to think about now . </s>
and the title of the one was , you know , a hundred percent . </s>
and we just started with a relatively strange <unk> history , where you could actually have a memory of a lot of a lot of a lot of you . </s>
on this island , that &apos;s the island of <unk> on the <unk> . </s>
yes , that &apos;s the data . </s>
there are a lot of people . </s>
today percent of malware percent of malware percent of malware percent . </s>
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ? </s>
it &apos;s just not going to be . </s>
if you &apos;re more <unk> each other , it &apos;s beginning to fail . </s>
i always tell you the politicians when they were in <unk> our facility . </s>
they always say why ? </s>
we have 20 percent in germany . </s>
but can &apos;t be a problem . </s>
but right now , we &apos;ve been not doing europe in europe and our network is really <unk> the european . </s>
if we &apos;d have europe in europe , we have the same problems that people have on this island there . </s>
the question was , the first thing that was <unk> , the first <unk> <unk> was <unk> , but just through the island . </s>
how big is actually a battery that is so battery so battery so that you have a <unk> island , <unk> , maybe even more successful , maybe even more successful . </s>
and yes again , i &apos;m going to go again . </s>
the conventional system is like all over the world . </s>
by the way , a year about a hundred yards performance on the planet . </s>
this is the performance of a hundred nuclear power , because it goes in the world . </s>
the world &apos;s most <unk> of the world , is going to be with light because you don &apos;t need it . </s>
the whole thing goes through . </s>
you &apos;re actually box . </s>
and then it looks like this . </s>
in the end of the classroom , three of the <unk> , two and the <unk> . </s>
yes , it &apos;s a burden down . </s>
we also have a very good data . </s>
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , in the rule of a system , a system that &apos;s just a <unk> system , which is just a <unk> system that can <unk> only in small amounts of a small amounts of <unk> . </s>
our goal was simply saying , okay , we &apos;re just saying our goal . </s>
and the <unk> is <unk> and wind &apos;s sun , the burden of the burden that they can take the larger rate . </s>
and if you want to talk about 20 , 30 percent of russia , so energy per year , not the performance in the moment , you have to have the light on the ground . </s>
that means that the moment you have to worry about that the renewables of the network of the network . </s>
you can only get it if you &apos;re familiar with some kind of another way of brazilian . </s>
it &apos;s done that nobody has done . </s>
that &apos;s basically a little style , so they can also be able to use their <unk> over a little bit of <unk> . </s>
people always ask me what &apos;s going on because there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> ? </s>
that &apos;s what it goes . </s>
but if you want to take a lot of these <unk> <unk> , and the most powerful thing , it &apos;s going to be complicated . </s>
and our goal was , we wanted to get to the table , and then there was this one , the last 10 , the last 10 , the last 10 , the last 10 , the last 10 , the last 10 , the last 10 , the last 10 , the batteries will not work . </s>
this is going to be on every case of any time , hydrogen methane , is becoming gas , you know , you know , that will be the one that will be then . </s>
you have to go and get a <unk> and not just <unk> <unk> . </s>
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , <unk> battery . </s>
how far does you get to work ? </s>
and then have a whole lot of simulation . </s>
and the wind and sun and sun and the burden of the <unk> , a very exciting result that you saw after 20 cents a <unk> , about fifty cents per <unk> , about <unk> cents per cent , about <unk> cents . </s>
these were the recent calculations about six years ago . </s>
and then we said , okay , okay , we &apos;re told . </s>
so , we have a business plan , we have a business . </s>
we are cheaper , when the average price five percent per year . </s>
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> . </s>
what would be done ? </s>
have been collected with investors , i &apos;ve got new <unk> . </s>
we were just five , in order to build a <unk> to build the society . </s>
and here &apos;s the plot . </s>
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system . </s>
that our system also has a <unk> , because we &apos;re still going to make 20 percent of the <unk> and also a <unk> on the other things . </s>
and the <unk> that the <unk> on the island , is that we find a little bit of great . </s>
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that the technical problem can solve the technical problem . </s>
and so we decided to build a hall to berlin in berlin , we &apos;re going to build the electric <unk> of the island of the island to three . </s>
that means we have a <unk> battery in the world . </s>
here &apos;s it . </s>
the scale from asia , in the event from japan . </s>
and <unk> is in the &apos; 70s , and the bbc of bbc , has been <unk> , and then <unk> to the japanese . </s>
you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery . </s>
she has a megawatt achievement and can take six hours to the performance and that &apos;s battery that we have <unk> <unk> . </s>
and they were doing it . </s>
we also have one of those <unk> in the same size , like he standing there , in the same size , the great battery is so , there &apos;s a big battery , right now , there &apos;s a big battery here , right now , there &apos;s a big battery here , where we are all the <unk> that we simulate the grid . </s>
here we simulate the whole <unk> that the cable <unk> of cable cable to the <unk> of the net . </s>
and here you can see again , you can see again . </s>
we can also <unk> the internet habit of <unk> . </s>
here we see this again here , we see the light , here again again , the whole thing . </s>
and what we did was , since then , since then , in the hall , until the hall , all of the speed of things , what we &apos;re doing is at electronics in electronics , we did software . </s>
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s just battery between the subject and the issue of the network and everything . </s>
you have to communicate , of course , you have to communicate with the network , and that &apos;s very complicated . </s>
the beauty is that you &apos;re going to be on this island today , you can be in this island now that we &apos;re going to get rid of problems that we &apos;re going to be going to be a <unk> of <unk> . </s>
so this whole discussion , how will be in the moment , and <unk> , <unk> , how to go to the go , for example , for example , for example , we <unk> the wind to 30 percent of the wind until 30 percent of the sun . </s>
<unk> offers itself . </s>
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere . </s>
we can start to integrate the island , <unk> , you can see the burden of the brain . </s>
that means when you &apos;re in the middle of the <unk> percent , you won &apos;t be able to do it without the memory . </s>
you can get through &apos; n <unk> , you can get through the law , yes , you should be doing that , you know , that &apos;s going to be able to recover the memory completely . </s>
and that &apos;s so the message of the embassy . </s>
so many people and look at the scene , because you can see that you can see what you get to see what you &apos;re going to get . </s>
if we put the light up , you have no more powerful mass , which is a certain culture in the net . </s>
and our main process of climate change is basically <unk> by large <unk> , where all the wave is everywhere around europe , where all the wave is in order to go around . </s>
we look at this grid , you see the energy , and when it &apos;s <unk> , we start a few <unk> <unk> , then we start a few <unk> <unk> , then a little bit of <unk> steam in the place . </s>
that &apos;s the system . </s>
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly <unk> . </s>
if you squint , it &apos;s a little bit of a while , but when you <unk> it . </s>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> , to keep the net of peace . </s>
and they can react to the time . </s>
if you don &apos;t have the more , these same mass mass , then you have to replace the <unk> and <unk> replace . </s>
and we can double <unk> <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s the enormous thing you see there is enormous <unk> there . </s>
and the message is now , we need to take that rotating , by the goals , if we can make our goals , 20 percent of the 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 percent and so on . </s>
then we need to break our <unk> capacity in the net . </s>
<unk> is called the power plant to keep the frequency . </s>
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> right now , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or <unk> because that &apos;s not going to happen . </s>
and we &apos;re trying to do that , you know , the <unk> capacity , you can break the capacity of the net , by raising the net memory into the net . </s>
and now , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies . </s>
and then , to that purpose , people are always looking and look at our <unk> on the surface of the world , you know , in a way of doing our <unk> . </s>
and yes , the discussion goes to the question , how far can you get there a bit far more <unk> . </s>
and many discussions that i &apos;ve had in the last couple of years , similar to the discussion that i &apos;ve been working in the last 30 years . </s>
not , is , <unk> , we &apos;ve got everything we &apos;ve got all of them , the way we never get . </s>
we have <unk> <unk> in germany . </s>
this is <unk> . </s>
and i just simply go out that we were in the next 30 years of all the capacity to <unk> the world in the world . </s>
it &apos;s just going to come . </s>
there &apos;s a whole lot of <unk> input and scales . </s>
the beauty is that i &apos;m sort of now in the last two years that the scientists are going to take on my side . </s>
we &apos;ve got a decade over 10 million <unk> now , also to <unk> , <unk> <unk> now . </s>
this is going to occur . </s>
so , from that &apos;s so , you know , there &apos;s a change in there and just be a change from this <unk> , and it just gives up a hundred billion right now . </s>
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s a lot like a <unk> system . </s>
so , in discussions , in discussions , these <unk> , which are making a very little network , which has been a very little network , which has been doing with our <unk> nothingness . </s>
the question is , but if you &apos;re totally independent , if you &apos;re totally independent or <unk> <unk> , the somewhere on the planet and then <unk> somewhere that will be a island . </s>
then you just use what the sun is , what they are there , where they live . </s>
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of a <unk> policy , and i &apos;m grateful grateful that they &apos;ve been told . </s>
and that &apos;s what we do , and the front of the things that are talking about , also the talk of <unk> <unk> , you can be a collective of a chick , and you can use a little bit together . </s>
and i want to encourage you just by just asking you that you &apos;re supposed to be a little bit crazy and a vision , you can have a vision of a little bit . </s>
and you really have to stay quite a <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to be . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
as steve lopez , the los angeles , one day by los angeles , one day through the streets in the middle of los angeles , he was listening to a wonderful music . </s>
she came from a gentleman , a african-american , <unk> , homeless , homeless , homeless , homeless , homeless . </s>
many of you may know the story , because of a <unk> paper , it was a book that was later on the <unk> of the <unk> , which was the <unk> minister of the <unk> , and he <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and he had <unk> <unk> . </s>
nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a streets of <unk> in the middle of los angeles . </s>
i &apos;m not recommend to read the book that they can &apos;t read , or to look at the wonderful connectedness , so they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that helped between those two men , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> from the street . </s>
i met 17 years ago in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall . </s>
he had a demo of beethoven and a half ago , and i came backstage , and came behind . </s>
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s all because of the dodgers never would never be in the baseball world in the <unk> of the first week of <unk> , the first of you . </s>
we &apos;d speak to speak music , and a few days later , i got a email that <unk> <unk> , that nathaniel me to be a <unk> . </s>
i have to mention that nathaniel a medical treatment for a medical treatment that has been treated with the dirt and with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . </s>
as a consequence , he &apos;s now <unk> for these kinds of anchor , which are sometimes bad , and he &apos;s got to have bad economic phases and he &apos;s <unk> , in the streets of <unk> , always , the <unk> of his own mind . </s>
and in a <unk> earthquake , nathaniel <unk> when we were endowed with our first <unk> in the walt disney hall . he had a <unk> <unk> in his eye and <unk> . </s>
he spoke about the invisible and smoke and <unk> and how it was a given for the reason . </s>
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i had scared that i could lose him , he could lose him that he could lose his relationship to violin , if i started talking about constraint and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> . </s>
so i just started playing . </s>
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven . </s>
and as i walked away , in <unk> , that in <unk> , a total shift in <unk> . </s>
it was like he had a impact under the impact of a unseen response , a chemical response , which was my game . </s>
<unk> <unk> anger , in understanding curiosity and dinosaurs . </s>
and as a miracle of it took his violin and began to play some distance from <unk> to play and asked me to play them , they were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
we started talking about music , starting from the bach , from being from being , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> . </s>
and i realized that he wasn &apos;t just a <unk> knowledge about music , but it was with you a tight personal personal relationship . </s>
he talked about her with a passion and a sense that i just could only be talking about my colleague in the <unk> of los angeles . </s>
by having his <unk> and talking about music was from this <unk> , <unk> man who had been a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , japanese , japanese , japanese , japanese , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean , clean
music is medicine . music is changing . </s>
for a health means of health , it means something like a health . </s>
because the music allows him to him , his thoughts and delusions of their imagination and creativity in some sense . </s>
and so he <unk> his <unk> . </s>
i understood that this is what the nature of art is . </s>
and that &apos;s why we do music , why we do something we do that in all of us , deep feelings , by inside the inside , in the inside , our artistic change reality , through our creativity . </s>
and the reality of all of us is all , and moving , inspired and united nations , inspired us . </s>
what nathaniel , the middle it came back into a community of friends . </s>
the <unk> force the music brought it back into a family of musicians who had understood his talent and it <unk> him . </s>
and i &apos;m going to take a <unk> , whether whether in the walt disney hall , or in <unk> , because he reminded me that i &apos;ve become a musician . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
bruno thanks very much . thank you . </s>
robert gupta . </s>
robert gupta : i want to play a <unk> stolen . </s>
i hope you pardon me . </s>
so i &apos;ve been a lot of living fish . </s>
i &apos;ve got two loved ones . </s>
this one , which was more like a <unk> affair . </s>
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good material , <unk> , a guy on the menu . </s>
what a fish . </s>
even better , he was convicted after the allegedly <unk> <unk> of sustainability . </s>
so you could get to sell it , and you could sell it . </s>
i had this beauty of a relationship with a lot of months . </s>
one day , the head of the company came from and i tweeted whether i could use a <unk> to the sustainability of the farm . </s>
&quot; of course i said . </s>
here was a company that was trying to solve what this is possible for this community , how do we keep fish in our insatiable elections ? </s>
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve got the ocean as we did , &quot; did we have the ocean . </s>
it &apos;s hard to <unk> . </s>
ninety percent of the great big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , <unk> , they are <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s almost left to the same . </s>
so , it &apos;s probably going to be a lawyer or <unk> , a part of our future . </s>
many arguments about it . <unk> <unk> , the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re very inefficient , and they &apos;re very inefficient , we &apos;re very inefficient . </s>
he has a <unk> of 15 . </s>
that means 15 pounds are required to get a pound <unk> . </s>
not very sustainable . </s>
not very good . </s>
so here was finally a company that tried to do it right . </s>
i wanted to have them . </s>
i called the ceo of the <unk> for the company for the company for the company . </s>
let him stop . </s>
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; <unk> &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right now , you &apos;re actually so far in the sea environment . &quot; </s>
&quot; the right , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out of our fish , not just the waste of our fish , not . &quot; </s>
and then he added it , we are basically a single world . </s>
this <unk> of <unk> <unk> , he said . </s>
&quot; the best in industry . &quot; </s>
one , great . </s>
&quot; s for a matter of what ? &quot; </s>
&quot; sustainable , he said . </s>
&quot; great , i said , &quot; i said . </s>
and at this dinner i lay in bed , and i thought , &quot; hell is a <unk> protein ? </s>
so i called the next day , the event of the event . </s>
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot; </s>
he said he doesn &apos;t know . </s>
now , i &apos;m a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a single answer to give me a complete response . </s>
let &apos;s call it the time . </s>
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; <unk> what to proteins about it ? &quot; </s>
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , &quot; did it come to <unk> . </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; yes , &quot; <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; how much more than <unk> is chicken ? &quot; </s>
in the assumption of maybe two percent . </s>
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent &quot; he said . </s>
i said , &quot; don &apos;t get to fish for the fish ? &quot; </s>
it was just a long pause in the middle and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot; </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> of this fish . </s>
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> . </s>
i was even more . </s>
no , i actually have a <unk> actually of this fish because , i swear with god who &apos;s chicken , who has chicken once after chicken . </s>
this is a different kind of struggle . </s>
it &apos;s the romantic way that you ever do , the way you &apos;re going to know the fish , you learn the fish . </s>
i was first <unk> at him in <unk> . </s>
one <unk> journalist had been talking about a fish . </s>
she has been a <unk> . </s>
he came up with a light bulb , almost <unk> color . </s>
the chef had him . </s>
wait . </s>
he still was still alive . </s>
who can make a fish so much taste after he was <unk> ? </s>
i can &apos;t , but this guy can be . </s>
we call it <unk> . it &apos;s called <unk> . </s>
and no , he didn &apos;t go up the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at the way , they and understand . </s>
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> <unk> . </s>
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner . </s>
she &apos;s near the river of <unk> . </s>
until the <unk> farm was the farm in the hands of <unk> . </s>
they were <unk> <unk> , which was basically the case . </s>
she made it by the land . </s>
they built this complicated by canals , and they built water from the country and out of the country and the <unk> in the river . </s>
now , they couldn &apos;t do that , not the economic . </s>
and it was a disaster . </s>
it took about 90 percent of the birds to what many birds are a lot of birds . </s>
and so , in a half a spanish , the country was bought with the country . </s>
what did you do ? </s>
they &apos;re the flow of the water . </s>
they literally <unk> the lever . </s>
instead of water , they used the channels of the canals , to <unk> the water back . </s>
they <unk> the channels . </s>
they created a <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction of the <unk> . </s>
the farm is incredible . </s>
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything . </s>
they looked at the horizon , the one million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and those density , lush . </s>
i was there not a long time with <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s a tremendous guy , three parts of charles darwin and a piece of &quot; a crocodile . &quot; </s>
okay ? there &apos;s been we and we were walking through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , and i <unk> up to my knees , and <unk> holds a <unk> . </s>
this is a rare <unk> <unk> . </s>
now , he &apos;s just the <unk> of phytoplankton . </s>
and here he looks a pattern of hearing patterns that &apos;s going to be the ultimate giraffe . </s>
it turns out that <unk> the largest part of the career in the national park in the national park in the national park in the national park . </s>
i asked him how he was walking to a <unk> . </s>
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about the fish . </s>
i &apos;m relations with relations . &quot; </s>
and then he goes and round in more recent years and algae <unk> , and weird <unk> . </s>
and don &apos;t mind me , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the way , in the art of <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s great , but i was in love . </s>
and my head was like this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had to do . </s>
so i got to get him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how do you feel so good ? &quot; </s>
he showed up the algae . </s>
&quot; i know , young , the algae , the <unk> , that &apos;s incredible . </s>
but what dinner is going to be ? </s>
how is the <unk> ? &quot; </s>
now , he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s been so sad to me that it &apos;s so sad food , which they would be in the wild . </s>
the total biomass , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish started . </s>
the system is so healthy . </s>
there &apos;s no food . </s>
the one farm that don &apos;t recommend in order to do their animals ? </s>
later on the day i was on this site with <unk> and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like , &quot; for a place , on the day , &quot; how do you ever see ? &quot; </s>
in the moment , it was a <unk> thing to do a <unk> . </s>
and we &apos;re looking at the corner and we were offered to the most incredible edible thousands and thousands and thousands of <unk> , a literally <unk> carpet . </s>
&quot; that &apos;s success . &quot; </s>
look at their own <unk> . </s>
she &apos;s <unk> . &quot; </s>
<unk> , i was outraged . </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t be your fish ? &quot; </s>
&quot; yes , he said . </s>
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> . </s>
well , last year , in this <unk> , more than a different species . </s>
it &apos;s the biggest and one of the most important private <unk> in a very europe . </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; is a good <unk> <unk> isn &apos;t the last one ? &quot; </s>
he also refused to be a head . </s>
he said , &quot; we build <unk> , not intense . </s>
this is a <unk> network . </s>
they were exploring . </s>
the shrimp eat . </s>
so the pinker the system is better . &quot; </s>
okay , let &apos;s rethink the <unk> that animals don &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that success to their success of health . </s>
one <unk> , but also a <unk> . </s>
oh , by the way , the way we &apos;re not even going to be there . </s>
she puts in a city hall , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> . </s>
every morning you go to a 240 mile . </s>
and they fly back to 240 miles . </s>
they do that because they can follow the <unk> <unk> effects . </s>
seriously . </s>
i had a journey of penguins , so i looked at the <unk> . </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re going to take a mile away from the farm and then fly it back up at night . </s>
do you make it for the children ? &quot; </s>
he looked at me as a boy about a song . </s>
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing this , because the food is better . &quot; </s>
i didn &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish , the <unk> was , and i don &apos;t like you , i don &apos;t like them . i don &apos;t like you . </s>
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste . </s>
i never get almost . </s>
and yet , when i put them in this restaurant in <unk> , she doesn &apos;t even look for <unk> . </s>
she was very encouraging and in as if you take a <unk> account of the ocean . </s>
i mentioned the opposite and he <unk> . </s>
he said , &quot; the skin is like a sponge . </s>
she &apos;s the last night before something in the body . </s>
she &apos;s actually developed in evolution , <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
and then he added it , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot; </s>
okay . a farm that didn &apos;t mean , a farm that &apos;s their success to success , the <unk> of their success . </s>
and then i realized when he says , a farm that didn &apos;t have <unk> , he <unk> , because the water that goes through this farm from the farm from the river flow . </s>
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s all the things that are <unk> to be associated with them , chemical pollutants , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> . </s>
and when it &apos;s defined by the system and this is the water &apos;s cleaner than a <unk> . </s>
the system is so healthy , the water . </s>
so not only one farm that don &apos;t require their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s <unk> to the health , but a farm that literally <unk> a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but also for you and me . </s>
because when the water freezes it , it &apos;s in the atlantic . </s>
a drop of the ocean , i know it , but i &apos;m going to take him , and they also do whatever they do , because these are the struggle . </s>
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good foods , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> . </s>
so what we need now is a radical concept of agriculture , from a <unk> , in the food industry in mind . </s>
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical . </s>
we &apos;re not <unk> , we <unk> . we &apos;re smitten . </s>
we love <unk> . we love small food . we &apos;re talking about regional food . </s>
and if you say that the things that the future is good to be a somewhere somewhere and says , &quot; hey , guys , i love <unk> , but how will they feed the world ? </s>
how will they feed the world ? &quot; </s>
can i be honest ? </s>
i don &apos;t like this . </s>
no , not because we already have enough calories to feed the world more than one . </s>
a billion people will be <unk> . </s>
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> . </s>
now , i don &apos;t like this because she has the logic of our <unk> that has been done about . </s>
the <unk> of grain of industries , chemicals <unk> on the earth , chemicals on fish , and the whole time they were simply saying , &quot; if we feed more people are thinking about how can be that ? &quot; </s>
that was the best . it was the central government . it was the <unk> of the american empire . </s>
we should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> capital , a <unk> , <unk> capital of <unk> capital that lets this production of production of this production . </s>
it &apos;s not agriculture . it &apos;s not agriculture . </s>
our transportation system is not a photographer because of <unk> <unk> , but because of the resources , but because of the resources , but because of the resources , but because of the resources , but because of the resources , but because of the resources , but because of the resources , but because of the resources , but because of the resources , but because of the
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> , not by <unk> water , not by <unk> , but by <unk> , not by <unk> and <unk> , but by the sea water , but through fish and fish , but through fish and fish , but through fish and fish , but through fish and fish , but through fish and fish , but through fish
feed the world ? </s>
let &apos;s start with question , how will we feed ourselves ? </s>
or better , how can we create a tool that can make any community to feed themselves ? </s>
to do that , look at the <unk> for the future . </s>
it &apos;s really a little bit . </s>
capital and machines are actually going to have a <unk> and never really good really good for food . </s>
let &apos;s look at the ecological model . </s>
this is that for two billion years <unk> . </s>
look like <unk> , farmers , like <unk> , and they look like <unk> . </s>
so , that &apos;s not the worlds of themselves , which is the main thing , rather than <unk> , the <unk> <unk> instead of just relationships , but they &apos;re experts for relationships , but they &apos;re experts for relationships . </s>
because they are the ones that experts are . </s>
and if i really am really honest , you know , i will ever be able to be able to be able to be . </s>
you know , this is right , because if that &apos;s good , the future is good , it &apos;s going to be delicious . </s>
thank you . </s>
if i want to show you a thing today that the totality of the data that we consume , greater than the sum of their favor and analyzing thinking of thinking about the sum of their <unk> and we won &apos;t use the way we can &apos;t really be visible . </s>
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> <unk> . </s>
the program that i use here is a little experiment . </s>
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a particular one , but we &apos;re now going to have a certain amount of an filter . </s>
and i see a different pattern that makes it really . </s>
and that &apos;s because , in the middle of the people , the most people are at the most <unk> and they &apos;re on the <unk> . </s>
we can take a step further and see the data and see that the <unk> and cancer tend to be the usual suspects of the <unk> . </s>
so if we &apos;re now moved on and age , say , we tell 40 years or we &apos;ll see that even the main thing is the most important thing about us . </s>
and who &apos;s looking at that &apos;s especially with these guys . </s>
so you realize that the pattern of information and data in this way , very much in this way in a lively <unk> . </s>
and if we can do this for raw data , why not content for content ? </s>
so what we are now here is the <unk> of everybody who has ever been printed . </s>
it &apos;s all online . it &apos;s all online . </s>
you can see it all my talk to their own city . </s>
with a <unk> cube , they can &apos;t be in a decade . </s>
they can take a particular year . </s>
you can jump straight to a certain way . </s>
now , if i look at this , i see the athlete that in this particular position and the <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m a lance armstrong , so i &apos;m blown away , so i &apos;m blown up all of the stories in which i could eventually be mentioned . </s>
now , if i want to get a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i want to have to be <unk> with the topic of the topic ? &quot; </s>
so i &apos;m going to take a step back and <unk> the perspective . </s>
now i see greg <unk> . </s>
and so you get a sense of that if you go to this information , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t get to <unk> , you don &apos;t just get to <unk> or not just <unk> . </s>
you make something that is actually a bit different . </s>
it &apos;s something we think about it , and we think it changes the way information . </s>
so i want to talk to this idea of about what a little bit of crazy is a little bit . </s>
and what we &apos;ve done is we have every single password , and they put a little summary . </s>
the summary contains a short picture of the area that comes from the front of the field . </s>
i just think the top 500 <unk> of the world . </s>
but even in that kind of view , we can do a lot of things . </s>
immediately we get a sense of the topics that are on wikipedia . </s>
i &apos;m going to choose to go on . </s>
now , after i left , i &apos;ve chosen that the <unk> that are most of the most people who are going to be wrong with me . </s>
this is really important , there &apos;s a piece that doesn &apos;t make a single insight . </s>
that &apos;s just when you get a step further and see the whole thing . </s>
if i could see a certain one of these , i can then put into the topic of time in the year and all together . </s>
so , if i know all these people , i know that the majority of these are the majority of these are the majority of the <unk> . some of the boss , some , come from the economy . </s>
and interestingly , a ted prize winner . </s>
so we can take a look at all ted &apos;s winners . </s>
you see , we surfing in the net first time , as though it was really a net of a net , not just from side , but a lot of money . </s>
and so i want to show you what a little surprise . </s>
i &apos;ll show you just the new york times . </s>
and <unk> , this is -- i want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s not a browser but you can see websites -- and we bring these <unk> website like this . </s>
so i can take a look back , and it &apos;s straight to a specific <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s why , because you just heard about the kind of websites in this way , and that &apos;s why we can see all the whole <unk> in the same way . </s>
so i can take my brain in a particular way . </s>
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that i was going to do . </s>
and i can sort of all now , again , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
and when i take a step back and look at everything , i can help my daily , maybe i &apos;m looking for bing , you may have seen the daily &apos; <unk> &apos; bing , here you see here , or <unk> . </s>
and then from here i can take over the side of the back and you again . </s>
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over again , and every time it does larger than the sum of the <unk> . </s>
in the moment , we think that data is a leader , we think that data . </s>
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> in information . </s>
what if we could turn this situation and the internet is so that we &apos;re starting to go instead from one another to the other , start from many things to go and see patterns that otherwise otherwise ? </s>
if we can do this , this is perhaps <unk> , maybe a new source of information processing . </s>
and , instead of moving in information , we can get to see it . </s>
and if we know , we can actually pull out the even <unk> from it . </s>
i hear a lot of sleeping . </s>
i grew up with a <unk> <unk> . </s>
in my <unk> , i was driving with the bus , every day one day a hour . </s>
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my thoughts in other worlds and in <unk> ways my thoughts in my mind , <unk> curiosity . </s>
and this curiosity showed that i was not in school when i was not in school , by the forest was , in school , and &quot; <unk> , frogs , frogs and snakes and <unk> , all home and <unk> , all right , all right , all right , all right , all right , all right , all right , all right , all right , all
i was totally <unk> , you know . </s>
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limits of the potential . </s>
and my love to science fiction , because then , in the late 60s , in the late 60s , we flew to the moon and the <unk> . </s>
jacques cousteau came in our living rooms that are <unk> us with his fascinating and places and a world of miracles showed us before we could never have been able to have before . </s>
it may seem good to <unk> <unk> . </s>
and i was blown artists . </s>
i could paint . </s>
and there &apos;s no video games to <unk> these <unk> movies with <unk> movies , i had to create the pictures in my head . </s>
we had to do that , if we were all born as a <unk> as a doctor , we took the description of the <unk> and the users in our heads . </s>
my response was the drawing of the drawing and paint from alien , and the <unk> , robots , and all of that . </s>
in the <unk> , i was constantly seeing the teacher , i like to see the <unk> , <unk> . </s>
the things had to get up in . </s>
and what i happened was interesting . what excites me about jacques cousteau <unk> was the idea of a perfectly unfamiliar in the world . </s>
i would never have a technological world with a spaceship , and that seemed quite unlikely . </s>
but here was a world that i could actually walk around here on earth and here was just fascinating and how all of that , and she was just fascinating and how to read this books . </s>
so i decided to get 15 , i decided to become a diver . </s>
the only problem of that i lived in a small village in canada , the united miles from the nearest sea . </s>
i &apos;m not going to go out . </s>
i <unk> my father , until he finally showed a <unk> in the middle of the <unk> , new york , right on the other side of the border , where we lived . </s>
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter , new york . </s>
the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later , i got two years later than we went to california . </s>
since then , in 40 years , the <unk> <unk> are the <unk> , i have about three hours under water . 500 hours of that . 500 hours of that . 500 hours of that . </s>
and i learned that the world &apos;s deep ocean in the <unk> ocean , so rich in the realm of life is how we can actually see it . </s>
nature knows the nature of nature , very , very , very human being human imagination . </s>
so i &apos;m interested in the last days , i see the <unk> awe of what i see on my way . </s>
and my love of the ocean is really , with the same intensity of how do they ever go and see . </s>
when i was a profession , a profession , it was a <unk> . </s>
the best way to do my inner way to try to make my need to make paintings , to unite . </s>
when i drew a kid , i &apos;m always comic comic book and so . </s>
so , movies , the way , images and stories , and the stories . </s>
of course , the stories i pulled out of the <unk> : &quot; a &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot; </s>
and in &quot; wonders &quot; could i connect my hand to the <unk> and the diving . </s>
so basically , my two is a <unk> . </s>
something called &quot; <unk> problem : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we had to solve such a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;re looking at <unk> animation , <unk> , back . </s>
what was the first <unk> <unk> that was ever in a movie vision . </s>
the film was not a money , just he played his <unk> , but i realized something else , but i realized something that &apos;s the audience around the world , which was happening . </s>
according to the fact that arthur law is not <unk> technology , and it &apos;s not going to be different . </s>
so , you saw something that &apos;s magic . </s>
and i found this really exciting . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wow , that has to be necessarily in the <unk> . &quot; </s>
so we went to two , &quot; my next film , still much more . </s>
with a <unk> , we created a guy out of liquid metal , and the success of the success of what effect would be like this . </s>
and it worked . we had some pretty interesting thing . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have the film that we had a little bit more money . </s>
from those two experiences from these experiences , was a whole new world of creativity . </s>
so i started a company , with my good friend of mine , <unk> , who was the best of the best friend and <unk> . </s>
the idea of that company was to start the stage of visual processes and the same way to start with the <unk> and the same way . </s>
and that &apos;s what we did , and we put a <unk> a gigantic cell . </s>
but the 1990s we realized that we could in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we did -- we started to slow the company -- actually , <unk> . </s>
i had this piece of &quot; avatar who &apos;s seeing this in order to create some of these neighborhoods and new effects in all visual heights , the <unk> should be made by <unk> , the <unk> should be made by <unk> , and the world should be <unk> . </s>
but the nice thing about it is that we didn &apos;t go back and people in my company said that we haven &apos;t able to be able to get them into the situation . </s>
so i got this other movie about the big ship , the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ve sold this as a &quot; and julia and julia on a ship &quot; sell &quot; a <unk> <unk> , a passionate movie , a passionate movie , &quot; just film . </s>
and the first thing i wanted to do was the real <unk> of titanic . </s>
i made the film . </s>
and that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know . </s>
i &apos;m convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to come to the heart . we &apos;re looking at the real area . </s>
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the movie . </s>
it &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot; </s>
and i &apos;m listening to fund . </s>
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s back to that , back to that fact that the reality is going to create a reality . </s>
and then we created six months later , in a russian <unk> <unk> , which i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles under the north atlantic , and i was titanic the real titanic through a <unk> . </s>
this was not a movie , not really . </s>
so , this has really been approached . </s>
and the idea are enormous . we had to build cameras and headlight and everything . </s>
and i noticed how much of these <unk> , one <unk> <unk> . </s>
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> . </s>
you go into this capsule , you put in this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is not going down to be a limited limited , if you don &apos;t . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just the same thing i was in a <unk> . </s>
this is really cool . &quot; </s>
i was a <unk> of the deep sea . </s>
anyway , from the part of the curiosity and science , it was all . it was all . it was curiosity . it was a lot curiosity . </s>
and it was a sense that i could not give me . </s>
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could take a visual effect , but i could not imagine what i &apos;d seen for the sake of the <unk> . </s>
in some of the following , i &apos;ve seen seeing seeing in <unk> , and sometimes i had things that i had never seen before and the science for the time , sometimes even things that we saw them , even though they saw no words . </s>
so this was really true , and i wanted to go to more . </s>
and so i met a little more unusual . </s>
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; says i want to tell my <unk> as a filmmaker to hollywood and a filmmaker to hollywood in hollywood and a while , for a while , <unk> . &quot; </s>
and then we started doing that , we started to go back to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and then she started with <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ll return to the titanic . </s>
we took small robots that we built a <unk> <unk> . </s>
our purpose was , <unk> and the interior of the ship was never done before . </s>
no one had ever had the inside of the <unk> device , you had no way to get the world we developed . </s>
and i &apos;m sitting now sitting on the deck of titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> that this <unk> here is quite similar to the other and i know that once , the band has been played there . </s>
and i fly with a little <unk> of the fish . </s>
i &apos;m actually just actually just , but my mind is within the future . </s>
it felt like i was physically the inside of titanic the titanic . </s>
this was the most <unk> shape of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i was a corner , i knew what was going on in the <unk> of the home , because i knew <unk> was <unk> <unk> . </s>
the state was , a really <unk> copy of the <unk> . </s>
so this was a strange experience . </s>
so , you made me this <unk> , you made such such <unk> using <unk> , and so that &apos;s how your consciousness in the vehicle , is accelerating in this other form of existence . </s>
really profound deeply about this . </s>
and also , a little bit of reference on what might be in some decades ago , if you have <unk> to study something to explore something or other things that i can envision as a <unk> . </s>
after that expeditions we started to see what we saw , really appreciate what we saw , really appreciate these <unk> , where we are seeing these incredibly amazing animals . that &apos;s a little extraterrestrial , but here &apos;s a whole new thing . </s>
they live with <unk> . </s>
they &apos;re not in a way we &apos;re doing that , how we do that . </s>
and so you can see , the right next to a 500 degrees centigrade is going to survive . </s>
now at the same time , i was very interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> of my childhood . </s>
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in the space and nasa who &apos;s planning to do with nasa and right now , in the <unk> and right now , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then our <unk> <unk>
that was fascinating . </s>
but at the end of it , i ran out of the deep sea in the deep sea . </s>
i took them with and <unk> with them , the world can be at the bottom : <unk> , people who are driving themselves to the extreme people , and they could test samples , and the instruments , they could test and so on . </s>
we &apos;re very excited , but actually , science , actually said , &quot; no science . </s>
so the circle of my existence as a <unk> , when a child , when kid was a kid , and the implementation into reality . </s>
in this country , i have a lot of learned . </s>
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m going to think you have to have a sense of how a <unk> or so . </s>
i &apos;m not a lot of leadership before i &apos;m going to use these expeditions . </s>
because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ? &quot; </s>
why do i do that ? &quot; </s>
this <unk> movies , we don &apos;t get money . </s>
we &apos;re playing the word . </s>
all of you think i was in between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; avatar and gave me somewhere else somewhere else . </s>
i &apos;ve all got this films , these <unk> , for a very small audience . </s>
no glory , no , no , no money . what do you do ? </s>
you &apos;re doing it to be the task of the challenge , and the ocean is the most <unk> environment that are there . you &apos;re doing it , you know , if a small group of the strange is that creates a team of people who are doing when a group of people &apos;s a team of people . </s>
because we did all this with only 10 people who have been <unk> for years , and sometimes we were having two to 12 , three to three months . </s>
and in this community , you know , the most important thing you see is that the one thing you &apos;ve got to do , because you have a task of a task , which is to be able to explain for you . </s>
if you go back to shore and imagine saying , &quot; we needed to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and that &apos;s the difficulty that the human <unk> , and that &apos;s the difficulty that people <unk> , and that &apos;s what common is common to explain to someone . </s>
there is a connection to respect . </s>
so when i was a <unk> , i tried to make my next film , which i tried to do , which was that you &apos;re respected in a team and then respect in the <unk> of respect . </s>
it was really changed . </s>
so , i was back with a little team on a <unk> terrain . we &apos;re looking at &quot; avatar with a new technique that had never been before before . </s>
incredibly exciting story . </s>
one more beautiful challenge . </s>
and we were to have a whole period of living in a right family . </s>
by doing this , my way to make movies . </s>
there were people who were thought , we could actually have these <unk> website , really well , on the planet , the planet <unk> . </s>
for me , it was more a more nuanced way to do my job to do my job that has changed in the outcome . </s>
so what can we possibly do from all of the solutions ? </s>
what lessons we learned from ? </s>
i think , in the first place , i guess . </s>
it &apos;s the most powerful human property . </s>
our imagination is a force that actually can create a reality that is actually a reality . </s>
and the one is more important for more than all the world &apos;s sake . </s>
to me , &quot; give me a advice , saying , &quot; give me a advice , how to do something like this . &quot; </s>
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you have a thing . </s>
so that &apos;s another thing that you don &apos;t do for you , not even yourself , not fighting itself . but you take risks to you . &quot; </s>
nasa &apos;s got a <unk> : &quot; failure is not a alternative . &quot; </s>
but in the art and the question and the study has to be a number of alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
no important policy that has been demanded without the risk of demanded . </s>
you have to take the risks to take care of these risks . </s>
this is the idea that i want to give you to you with the journey , and is certainly a alternative , fear . thank you . </s>
today , i &apos;m talking about energy and climate change . </s>
and that surprised may something because my classmates used to start with the foundation and the seeds of things that we &apos;ve been building and the <unk> to allow the <unk> to allow the city of the world . </s>
but energy and climate change are extremely important for these people , right more important than anyone on the planet . </s>
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing , it &apos;s too much , it &apos;s too much , it &apos;s too much , how do you change your diet environment , how it can &apos;t be able to withstand their diet environment . </s>
it leads to uncertainty . it feeds it . it feeds . </s>
so , a climate change is you &apos;re going to be . </s>
furthermore , the <unk> is very important . </s>
in fact , if you could only be one of the price of the price , to the <unk> would be in the most effective if you could go to the most effective . </s>
well , the <unk> is over time . </s>
in fact , the <unk> <unk> . </s>
the <unk> industry kept the industrial revolution in the 20th century and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> and we have refrigerators to make the things that we do so many things . </s>
so we &apos;re going to get electricity in a wonderful situation in the world . </s>
but when we &apos;re using the price of the price -- let &apos;s take the price of the price -- we &apos;ll meet a new file and this barrage with co2 . </s>
co2 course , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear . </s>
they <unk> the <unk> co2 that has been leading to <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative effects . the weather and the <unk> has some very negative effects of changes in the weather and so , the whole systems . </s>
now , the exact current relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where their own follow , there are some <unk> , but not many . </s>
and there &apos;s a moral ambiguity of how bad this will be going to be going to be the same ! but they &apos;re extremely reluctant to be terrible ! </s>
i asked the <unk> , asking we really need to come down to the zero of the city ? </s>
not half a quarter of a quarter ? &quot; </s>
the answer is to get close to zero , the temperature continues to increase . </s>
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge . </s>
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a three-and-a-half foot of a decent truck , which is to a three foot of a three foot . you can see it from underneath it . </s>
this is a zero level . </s>
well , we &apos;ve been able to give up a lot of <unk> , about 26 billion tons of 26 tons . </s>
every american tons about 20 tons of poor , less than one . </s>
in the average , it &apos;s about five tons of every on the planet . </s>
and somehow we need to start changing zero , which is the zero . </s>
it &apos;s been constant . </s>
only economic economic changes , it influenced it and we have to go from <unk> rise and go to zero levels of reduction and to zero . </s>
this equation , a little bit of design . a little bit of design . a little bit of a <unk> . you have this thing -- co2 and co2 -- that &apos;s the number of people depend on average , the average energy for each human and the co2 that are going to be a <unk> . </s>
so let &apos;s look at every single factor of the things we get to zero , we &apos;re going to get this up . </s>
probably has to come up with a <unk> of these numbers . </s>
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but we &apos;ll go through . </s>
we first set up the population . </s>
today billion people , <unk> , <unk> billion people . </s>
and it &apos;s not going to move down to nine billion <unk> to move down onto the countryside . </s>
if we &apos;re very successful with new physical , the <unk> and <unk> , we may have the worst price of 10 percent of the age , but at the time we see a slope . </s>
the second factor of services , we use . </s>
all of these things that we eat , we eat , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
these are very good things about , and <unk> means that it &apos;s almost a whole available to the planet . </s>
it &apos;s a great number of things . </s>
in the world , in the rich world , we may have been able to get symptomatic <unk> , and less use , but in the average world , that number one year , and then the more complex than doubles the person . </s>
here we see a very basic service . there is light to be light , so you can read the homework . </s>
and these students have not , so they don &apos;t get to come and read their <unk> under the <unk> . </s>
now , efficiency , the e of energy per service , there is finally good news . </s>
we have something that doesn &apos;t get up , that &apos;s not going to be up . </s>
now , in the <unk> , by other <unk> , through other <unk> , through new methods , there are many services that have some services to deny 90 percent of 90 percent . </s>
in other places , like <unk> , <unk> shares : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , is the <unk> or <unk> , who is a lot smaller . </s>
in addition to us , we get to maybe one of a reduction to a factor of a factor of a may even more <unk> , or maybe even a factor of a factor of a <unk> <unk> . </s>
but at the first three , we &apos;re now 26 billion tons of <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s not a simple thing to do ! and that &apos;s not a simple thing to be . </s>
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and this is a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that are going to be a unit of <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get this up . </s>
if you burn coal , it &apos;s no . </s>
when they &apos;re natural . </s>
almost every single <unk> of electricity today , except for renewables and <unk> . </s>
so , what we need to do is to create a new system , to create a new system . </s>
we need <unk> . </s>
now if i use the phrase &quot; using &quot; lunch , &quot; don &apos;t i understand the impossible . </s>
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle . </s>
the internet is a miracle . </s>
so people have to be able to help the development of these miracle . </s>
there is no evidence to a place to a particular date , you need to have a particular model to a date . </s>
normally , you know , you &apos;re just looking at a time and some of them come together . </s>
in this case , we have to give up and <unk> and a miracle in a very short time . </s>
well , i wondered how can i really manipulate it ? </s>
there is a natural selection , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of people here ? </s>
i reminded myself last year when i got a graduate student and somehow i liked the people . </s>
the idea was really , for you know , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos . </s>
and for energy , this is a guy . </s>
i decided that the whole thing was to be my favorite contribution to the environment . </s>
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies . </s>
you &apos;ve got to tell me that they don &apos;t bite . it &apos;s actually not even the glass of failure . </s>
now , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get much . </s>
we need solutions to either one or a large scale and unimaginable , and even though there are many directions , where people have come to , i &apos;m really just five to five , actually , just i &apos;m really going to have the big wheels . </s>
i have tides , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and this may be a <unk> contribution and if you &apos;re a better way to be a better way to do , but my favorite here is that we have to work on all of these five work , and we can &apos;t give them because they were , because they have been significant , because they have been interested in trouble . </s>
let &apos;s look at the burn fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas . </s>
what you have to do is you have to get there , but it &apos;s not . it &apos;s not . you have to have all the co2 that come from the <unk> , and then <unk> under pressure and then somewhere else and hope that there was . </s>
there are some <unk> that &apos;s coming up to a 60 percent -- 80 percent of 80 percent level , but it &apos;s 100 percent to get it up . but the biggest issue here is a big challenge . but the biggest issue here is a big challenge . </s>
who will make it ? </s>
who can do something like a <unk> , which literally could greater than any kind of trash of <unk> and other things can be done ? </s>
this is a lot of volume . </s>
so this is a tough transformation . </s>
next , <unk> . </s>
the woman also has three big problems , the cost , especially in <unk> countries , and that question in <unk> countries , the question that you really feel that can &apos;t be wrong is not using the fuel . </s>
and what do you do with waste ? </s>
he &apos;s not very big about it , there &apos;s a lot of concerns . </s>
so three tough problems that may be solvable and how many soluble people should work . </s>
the last three of five girls , i &apos;ve got a lot of . </s>
it &apos;s the renewables that they are often called a lot of times . </s>
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks . </s>
one is the process that these technologies are creating dramatically lower than the <unk> . </s>
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , the more than a normal power plant . </s>
and the <unk> <unk> : this is the vents </s>
the sun doesn &apos;t seem full of the whole day , but also , as well as the <unk> and the <unk> . </s>
so , if you depend on from this sources of sources , a way that energy is also in times , which is also not available to get it available in times if you &apos;re not available . </s>
there &apos;s big <unk> . there are challenges at the same time , if we say that the energy outside the country is not only the technology of the country , they have to deal with the risk of where the risk of work . </s>
and there &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
and to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are produced , computers , cell phones , computers , cell phones , computers , cell phones , computers , cell phones that we &apos;re producing , the batteries that we &apos;re producing , computers , cell phones that we could now take less than 10 minutes of the <unk> . </s>
so we need a big breakthrough that is going to be better than the 100 percent better than the most famous thing to do . </s>
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy to be . </s>
this is what happens when you tried to get this <unk> sources of numbers -- 30 percent of the interior of the interior . </s>
if you want to get 100 percent of what they need an incredible <unk> . </s>
well , where we go , what is the right approach ? </s>
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ? </s>
and what we need is a lot of companies that are working on . </s>
in every one of these five regions of the five regions , we need to have 100 people in the five regions . </s>
in many , you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good . </s>
i guess here &apos;s ted group there are many people who are already there , there are many people who are already there . </s>
bill has invested several companies , under some of these <unk> who has been <unk> fantastic . </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , great enough and interesting opportunities and interesting opportunities and i try to get it . </s>
nathan myhrvold and i have a company that &apos;s maybe surprisingly , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear power has been tracked . </s>
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> . </s>
and this industry has been celebrated in this industry from a industry ago , so it &apos;s not great surprise that some good concepts of mine . </s>
the <unk> means that you instead instead of a part of the <unk> , which we decided to burn the 99 percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent . </s>
this is a very crazy idea . </s>
but in fact , you had a long time , but you could never get reasonable reasonable , but you could never get reasonable , but there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s a modern supercomputer , it looks like that , it looks like that . </s>
and because , you know , it &apos;s 99 percent , the <unk> is much better . </s>
in fact , you know , you know , the trash is the trash of magnitude of reactors as a <unk> . </s>
instead of having the head of the <unk> , you just get it . </s>
the uranium will be planted , a little bit like a candle . </s>
you can see that there &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; <unk> &quot; the &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
the solves really <unk> . </s>
here &apos;s a picture of a graphic <unk> . </s>
this is the waste of the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s been burned today , <unk> , so it &apos;s called <unk> . </s>
the u.s. government is hundreds of years . </s>
and if you &apos;re cheap and easy , you get enough to get your fuel fuel for the planet . </s>
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s a lot of <unk> from the concepts that we need to come to go forward . </s>
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success . </s>
how should we look like our own ? </s>
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to do , and then we &apos;ll talk about the <unk> . </s>
many of the things about a 80 percent reduction to 2050 . </s>
it &apos;s really important that we get there . </s>
the rest 20 percent will be synthesized in poor countries , and hopefully , and hopefully , hopefully , will be <unk> and cement . </s>
so , to reach these 80 percent to reach the research , including countries , their <unk> completely <unk> . </s>
the other note is whether we can see the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way they &apos;re on the rest of the rest . </s>
it &apos;s great . </s>
this is becoming a <unk> . </s>
if we go back to the 2020 of what would be the 2020 ? </s>
it should be a little bit of the two elements . </s>
we should use the <unk> to get back to the way we get more <unk> , the less we will be able to be the <unk> and the temperature . </s>
but actually , this is the note of the things that we do not make sense to the extent of the big <unk> , just a minute , or even less important than the other that we have . </s>
this breakthroughs must be done with <unk> and we can measure measure , in <unk> and <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of great books . </s>
the al gore said we have the choice and david <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
they really do it by and create a frame where can be augmented by the way , because we need to get to all the sides of all sides . </s>
there are some competing that have to come together . </s>
that &apos;s a wish . </s>
a very clever wish we invent . </s>
if you &apos;re only a desire for the next 50 years , i could see the president of the president , a vaccine , and i love this wish , the <unk> <unk> without co2 without co2 that are the <unk> of the desire . </s>
this has impact on the biggest effect . </s>
if we don &apos;t get this desire , the east will be the east between rural and the other people are terrible people between poor and the <unk> and china and almost all of the lives are much worse . </s>
so what do we do ? </s>
for the sake of services i ? </s>
we need to use more power . </s>
when countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they don &apos;t just talk about co2 . </s>
they should take these <unk> <unk> , and they were shocked by the top small <unk> that would be a innovative . </s>
we need <unk> , <unk> , &amp; amp ; t ; we can &apos;t make a difference . </s>
we need to spread the message . </s>
we need to make dialogue and <unk> things that are going to be undertaken by the government . </s>
it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can make it . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
thank you . thank you . </s>
thank you very much . just to understand some things that can be better -- you can give us a notion of the scale of these . </s>
bill gates : to try to get the simulation on a supercomputer , all major scientists to get a lot of scientists , we need some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials into a russian place to ensure that it works in the <unk> . </s>
the uphill step is the building of the first <unk> , another billion , the <unk> and the place of the fact that actually makes it . </s>
the first thing is , if he &apos;s like , as if it &apos;s like , all right , it &apos;s all clear , because the basic density of the energy is so different as a <unk> as we know it . </s>
to build this right : that &apos;s deep down into the ground almost almost like a vertical <unk> nuclear <unk> , and then it starts up the process and keep going up on the bottom of the bottom . </s>
<unk> : right . now , you &apos;ve got to get rid of the reactor and many of the reactions that can go wrong and give it many more , and that &apos;s not good ! and it &apos;s not good ! </s>
but if you &apos;ve got very cheap fuel fuel , you can see it for 60 years -- think of a column -- the column -- they &apos;re <unk> -- they &apos;ll be able to use the entire <unk> . </s>
and it &apos;s done it &apos;s done . </s>
a <unk> that &apos;s a solution to the garbage for the garbage for the garbage for the garbage . </s>
<unk> : yes . now what the trash is , you can sit it , you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- take it into the next and burn it . </s>
and we start by looking by looking at the trash that already exists in these degraded or <unk> at the reactors of the reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> . </s>
so what this reactors is a problem problem , what we &apos;re in our living room and that &apos;s the <unk> dramatically of the process of this process . </s>
but as you have been talking to different people about these opportunities in which these opportunities are spoken about this . </s>
where is the greatest interest in which really is really what makes us ? </s>
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t yet yet a place called us , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for anything that &apos;s &quot; nuclear interest in the name of the world , india , india , china ... &quot; and the people in the world were talking about how to <unk> this . </s>
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese things have done something that happened . </s>
this is a nuance of a thing that was made . </s>
this is a more important step , but it &apos;s like a faster and some countries have this built , that &apos;s why anybody and that has built that , that &apos;s why everyone has a <unk> for our first time . </s>
in their imagination , we &apos;re looking at a little bit of a life ? </s>
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to reinvent and then 20 years . </s>
this is sort of the closest to us that the <unk> movement that we have to do . </s>
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that &apos;s a big desire , could it easy . </s>
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies in companies we need hundreds of the same as much as if their approaches work , for the pilots , for the pilots , for that for the pilots , for that for the pilots , for that for the pilots , for that for the pilots , for that for the pilots , for that for the pilots , for that
and it would be best if it could be a blend , because you could use a mixture . </s>
anyway , we need a solution . </s>
the great deal of breakthroughs , is this a lot that you know ? </s>
<unk> is the most important thing . </s>
it would be without the <unk> , but the power it has so much more important . </s>
in the context sector , there are other innovative companies . </s>
you know , we know , their work doesn &apos;t really good , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is a different approach . </s>
there is a huge <unk> that &apos;s hard to think about , but maybe the one thing that we have . </s>
and so , there is several different , but the beauty of it is that a <unk> million times like a <unk> , and so if you &apos;ve been able to deal with the problems and the cost of the land , the potential , the implications of the country , so the effects of the country , is the implications of the country . </s>
if that &apos;s not what then ? </s>
to try to keep the <unk> stable to try to keep the <unk> stable ? </s>
<unk> : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you too much eating , and you just got a heart attack . what do you do ? </s>
there is a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> calls that has different <unk> to the warming , so we have 20 or 30 years more to pass around us . </s>
this is just a <unk> . </s>
you don &apos;t need that . </s>
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t only do not only work at the insurance , because you &apos;re going to make a sense of the <unk> , so you know , because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> rescue . </s>
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re smart , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> , whether the things are going to come faster , or if we &apos;re going to have things faster , and we expect innovation to do that . </s>
<unk> : do you have two sentences for you to convince them may be ? </s>
<unk> : now , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different from different countries . </s>
those who make scientific arguments , very little . </s>
tell you that there are negative effects that we have to do with the clouds that we want ? </s>
there are very , very few things that you can say to you about that , from which there is a chance of a chance in a million . </s>
this is like aids . </s>
you do the mistakes , and you &apos;ll get it very much later . </s>
and so the idea now is now , if you have all kinds of problems , in a little bit of a time , from what you &apos;ve got to do -- and that &apos;s what you get -- and that &apos;s what the investment is not so clear . it &apos;s actually not so clear . it &apos;s a big <unk> . </s>
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about . </s>
but my dream here is that if you can do it economically , and the co2 that you could do it , the <unk> , then the skeptics , but i &apos;m going to be a skeptic that it &apos;s not a lot of <unk> , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper the previous thing , but i &apos;m going to be more likely to
and that would be their answer to the <unk> <unk> that if you use all this time and energy use of co2 and energy to solve the co2 emissions , all the other goals are suffering , money that are better to invest in malaria , and there &apos;s a dumb waste of resources that we can do . </s>
<unk> : now , the real research industry will say -- let &apos;s say the u.s. billion a year more than you now -- that &apos;s not the case that &apos;s been so dramatic . </s>
there should be no suffering . </s>
you get to <unk> , and here &apos;s reasonable people disagree with people , if you have something that doesn &apos;t give you something that &apos;s what &apos;s rational , and it tries to fund . </s>
it &apos;s very soon about a <unk> and funded funded , just the one that i think is the only one , i think we should try to be a lot more of the things that have potential to be a lot . </s>
if you get the <unk> , you get a very high <unk> , then you can only get the rich . </s>
i mean , everybody from us here could spend a lot of our energy to change their lifestyle . </s>
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster . </s>
and even <unk> <unk> . </s>
his new business model is , &quot; why is the research not anymore ? &quot; </s>
he &apos;s still understood for his former stories , with the former soviet stories , but he has understood that this is a very <unk> group , and therefore he brings now the <unk> . </s>
and this is a <unk> that i think of my life . </s>
research is just insane , how little it supports the world . </s>
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about all people here when i say , i really hope that you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much . </s>
<unk> : thank you . </s>
a few years ago , here was ted , called a <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
the idea is quite simple . <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , about 20 , about 20 , about a meter in a marshmallow and a marshmallow . </s>
the marshmallow is to be the marshmallow . </s>
and , though , though , it &apos;s really hard to think it really hard , because it actually makes people very quickly . </s>
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve got it into a <unk> . </s>
it was a big success . </s>
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> <unk> and architects &apos;s something about nature and i want to share some of them . </s>
normally , most people are getting to themselves at the task to fly . </s>
they talk about what it is going to look like it is , you know , it &apos;s <unk> to power , you know , it &apos;s <unk> to power . </s>
then you invest a little bit of a time in planning and organization . they make it a little bit of time . </s>
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . </s>
and finally , you know , before you have no time , you take somebody to the marshmallow and you put it on the top , you &apos;ll step back to the top , you step back and &quot; <unk> , &quot; you &apos;re going to get your work . &quot; </s>
but what then goes almost every time , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; to a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the brain is that the whole thing is happening and <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more <unk> , and under the <unk> , and under the <unk> , and under the <unk> . </s>
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and really <unk> the brain . </s>
and of course , there &apos;s also a lot of the many more advanced <unk> , and under the best we have <unk> of course , the best of <unk> <unk> . </s>
and this is quite extraordinary . </s>
how do you make sure you &apos;re not just the greatest towers , but also the most interesting structure of all . </s>
what you may be wondering , how do that ? why ? what about the world ? what about ? </s>
and peter told : &quot; neither of children were going to be the head of <unk> . &quot; </s>
they invest in <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s another reason . </s>
and that &apos;s that <unk> <unk> , the one should be trained to find a proper plan . </s>
and then it &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
what happens when they get the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have time anymore and what &apos;s happening ? </s>
it &apos;s a crisis . </s>
what ? </s>
what &apos;s different from the marshmallow and prototypes , successful , successful prototypes , always with the end of the top , so that they have the ability to fix the possibility of leadership . </s>
<unk> , the way that a collaboration is <unk> . </s>
and with everybody , trying to get out of feedback , which does not work . </s>
so the performance , with prototypes , but we &apos;ll see how different teams are looking at , but we see how different teams are . </s>
the average of most of most of the most lies in most of it is about <unk> , <unk> , but not much , <unk> are better than adults . </s>
who is most successful ? </s>
architects and engineers , for the sake . </s>
so , in a way , the highest thing i saw . </s>
and why ? because they triangles triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are key to build their structures . </s>
it &apos;s interesting about average , but here &apos;s interesting . </s>
you can get a <unk> administrator on the team , they will be <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s amazing . you can see around and see it , &quot; this one &apos;s going to win . &quot; </s>
you can predict it . why do that ? </s>
because they have special skills of the <unk> . </s>
they actually get it . </s>
and the team that regulates the performance is actually going to take a team of the team . </s>
and more and their combination and their combination . </s>
if you have 10 teams that were typical , they get about six , the <unk> . </s>
so i tried to try something interesting . </s>
i thought we &apos;ll take the <unk> . </s>
so i offered a <unk> prize for the winners . </s>
what do you think about these <unk> ? </s>
what was the result ? </s>
this is not a team of a prisoner &apos;s dilemma . </s>
if you had a <unk> <unk> <unk> , he would have the price of home . </s>
so , it &apos;s not interesting that high school have a strong effect ? </s>
we &apos;re looking at the same practice . </s>
what do you think about ? </s>
now , you know , the advantage of the brain . </s>
so , bad team is a team under the best . </s>
they produced the highest construction in the time . </s>
there are a <unk> lessons for us to nature about nature and success . </s>
you might say , why would somebody actually invest time for a moral philosopher ? </s>
the reason is i &apos;m using digital tools and processes to build teams , and we &apos;re creating cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
and what the <unk> does is they need to identify the hidden light organs . </s>
because frankly , each project has its own marshmallow . </s>
the challenge provides a common experience of having a common language , the most common language . </s>
and this is the value of the experience of this . </s>
and those of you who are interested in , <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s a blog where you see the <unk> <unk> . </s>
there is a <unk> there . </s>
you find crazy examples of all the world , how people are the system and <unk> . </s>
there are also <unk> . </s>
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is the nature actually actually a <unk> sports . </s>
it demands that we all senses our senses to the task and we think that we think we think our feelings and our bodies , where our feelings are in front of us . </s>
and sometimes a little intrigued of this experience all the experience of this experience -- &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment . </s>
and that can make a big difference . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
so we have a machine , we do a machine , we do a machine . </s>
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time , it &apos;s a <unk> machine . </s>
and everybody in this room has to be . </s>
and you can go into the past , you can &apos;t go in , you can &apos;t be in here ; you can stay in here and now stay here . </s>
and i wonder what they were choosing , because i was my friends in my friends , they were often asked to the past . </s>
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time , before cars were going to be back to the bottom . </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
i &apos;m convinced you , you know , you kind of <unk> to <unk> . </s>
and i understand . </s>
i have to say , &quot; i have to say . </s>
i don &apos;t want to be because i &apos;m a adventurers , adventurers . </s>
it &apos;s because of the planet , on this planet , they go forwards . </s>
so i want to go into the future , and i want to go into the future . </s>
this is the greatest time that the planet has ever been on this planet , irrespective of the other , health , wealth , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
there was never a time like that . </s>
my <unk> died of them . </s>
my grandparents were on the <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> . </s>
so , that &apos;s where we stand a nine at the beginning of my <unk> . </s>
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a larger thing than that . </s>
a child , that today in new york can be expecting to live in new york about 100 percent . </s>
think about it . that &apos;s a incredible fact . </s>
and why is that ? </s>
smallpox smallpox . the smallpox has been killed on this planet . </s>
they have the demographics of the earth in a way that it hasn &apos;t been a war . </s>
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone . </s>
we &apos;ve got it <unk> . </s>
in the wealthy world , we have diseases that millions of us only have been threatened in a generation of time . </s>
<unk> ... <unk> ... </s>
does anyone know that &apos;s what that is ? </s>
vaccines medicine , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of scientific . </s>
and from my perspective , the scientific method , things like , look , if it doesn &apos;t work , it does change if it &apos;s not doing it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity . </s>
so that &apos;s the good news . </s>
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve got it often in the case , they &apos;ve got it . </s>
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this planet every day . </s>
this number is up , and they &apos;re very quickly , and that &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
and not only that we have our imagination to be the world &apos;s most interesting . </s>
drinking water , rainforests , rainforests , oil , gas , and if we haven &apos;t disappear , and if we don &apos;t disappear , we can go from that mess we &apos;re going to go out and disappear from this chaos . </s>
so the question is , we can do that , i think , can we do that . </s>
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that feed billion people feed without the land that they live in . </s>
i think we can power this world with power that they don &apos;t destroyed at the same time . </s>
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> . </s>
but this is what i &apos;m here -- one of the things that drew me is that the thing as me is as fixing as possible as this as fixing as possible as it is , never , but that &apos;s never going to be as reliable as well as possible . </s>
and we were also able to have a more <unk> , so we can see it in the way we can now . </s>
we &apos;re at the threshold of astonishing , amazing events on many of the areas , and yet i really think that we &apos;re hundreds of , 300 years ago , and yet , i really think that we &apos;re hundreds of the things that are the enlightenment , more than now . </s>
people are saying that you can &apos;t believe that you can &apos;t manipulate it , you can &apos;t free . </s>
not even the truth will be free . </s>
and listen , everybody has a right way to look at his mind ; even a right on his opinion , the progress of his mind . </s>
but you know , what you don &apos;t know ? </s>
they have no right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have . </s>
and i have a little bit of a while , to find out . </s>
so i wrote a paper about a decade of reading a paper about a new yorker , a little article . </s>
and i was amazed by resistance resistance , on resistance to the most of the most effective in health care in the history of humanity . </s>
i don &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i always do , i just wrote a paper and headed . </s>
and soon i wrote a paper about a <unk> <unk> . </s>
the same thing . </s>
people are crazy . </s>
so i wrote a paper written , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was the <unk> , why they believed that molecule was a random kind of <unk> a random way of a particular kind of <unk> on nature . </s>
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote a paper , i was going to go on . </s>
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist , journalist . </s>
we &apos;re going to be a rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay . </s>
but this article made me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , why , and finally i found it . </s>
and that &apos;s because that &apos;s the magic that i &apos;m offering at all , no . </s>
these were people people , people , decent people , decent people . </s>
they were just like the people in this room . </s>
and this was so disturbed me so that ... </s>
but then , you know , we know what , we were honest , honest . </s>
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t think about the same proportion of progress . </s>
we &apos;re talking about <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re talking about it , with little quotes &apos; 86 . &quot; </s>
okay , for that , we know what the reasons that are the ones . </s>
we &apos;ve got this confidence in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of the science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be so . </s>
you can call a few name people , and they will understand . </s>
even more <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , weapons , the <unk> 2000 . </s>
i mean , you can choose your own list . </s>
there are questions and problems with people that we believed they were always quite comfortable . they &apos;re skeptical . </s>
ask you ask , ask them , ask them , ask them . </s>
don &apos;t take a look at it . </s>
but now , if you get evidence of evidence you need to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at . </s>
and i can tell that from the reason we &apos;re now in a epidemic of fear , like i &apos;ve never seen them and never again again . </s>
so a story about 12 years ago , a horrible story that <unk> the <unk> story with measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine in connection . </s>
very frightening . </s>
as a result , the one was to see if they were . </s>
clean studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue . </s>
the data came down . </s>
the data came from the united states , from sweden , from sweden , from canada , and they were all alike , no correlation , no connection , no connection . </s>
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make a difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe we really feel really feeling . </s>
we don &apos;t believe in a <unk> documents of a <unk> that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at , and i understand that , i think that &apos;s what we all do . </s>
but you know what ? </s>
the result of it was a <unk> , that &apos;s a result . </s>
because of this fact , the united states is one of the world &apos;s only countries in the world , in which the <unk> for the birds . </s>
that &apos;s <unk> and we should be ashamed . </s>
it &apos;s awful . </s>
what happened to be able to do that . </s>
well , i understand that . </s>
because what did it get here ? </s>
a single in the audience is going to be able to see somebody who die ? </s>
it doesn &apos;t happen . </s>
in this country , not even in this country , but the u.s. is in the last year . </s>
these are deaths by measles , 20 per hour . </s>
but because this is not what happened here is we can actually use it , and people like <unk> can come and design shared and design of fear and illiteracy and larry king live . </s>
and they can &apos;t aggregate because they connect and stuff . </s>
you don &apos;t understand that these things are going to be a very common thing , but almost the same thing . </s>
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quickly . </s>
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> . </s>
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity . </s>
no fear , no fear , <unk> , disappeared , disappeared . </s>
the guy in the middle not have been so much . </s>
he &apos;s paul <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s just a few other people . </s>
he can save the lives of <unk> , saving children per year in the developing world . </s>
pretty good ? </s>
now , besides , apart from that paul and talk about vaccines and talking about vaccines and says , how valuable you are , and that &apos;s how valuable you should be . </s>
and he &apos;s actually like this . </s>
paul is a terrorist . </s>
if paul is a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell the red <unk> statements . </s>
he gets to home calls because people tell him that they know where they go to school . </s>
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine . </s>
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential . </s>
you take them , return , you know , horrible disease , and that &apos;s what happened . </s>
we &apos;re now going to take a look at this land . </s>
and this is going to be worse , and pretty soon , children will die because that &apos;s just a question . </s>
and they &apos;re not just going to die . </s>
what about <unk> ? we &apos;re doing that . why not ? </s>
one <unk> of me was written me a couple of weeks ago , and i got a little too <unk> . </s>
nobody &apos;s ever heard of it . </s>
she would not be <unk> . no case . </s>
we found . </s>
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> , and you know what ? </s>
we didn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> . </s>
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe even a morning in lagos , and i just got a plane to los angeles , right now . </s>
and in a few hours , he took and <unk> a car , and he &apos;s going to beach and he &apos;s going to be one of those <unk> tonight tonight . </s>
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s been infected with a <unk> illness , and we don &apos;t know that , because that &apos;s how it works . </s>
this is the planet that we live . don &apos;t do that as if he didn &apos;t do it . </s>
we love to try to do that . we love it . </s>
do you have any of your vitamins ? </s>
<unk> , a little <unk> that you can get to the operation . </s>
i know that they did that because they americans have the one of the day . </s>
they take the stuff , and you take more interesting than we find that , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference how we find find that they are useless . </s>
the data is doing . </s>
they never get to do more . </s>
that &apos;s okay , they want to take 28 billion , pay producers . </s>
i &apos;m not going to share with you . </s>
dark . </s>
why do we do that ? why do we do that ? </s>
well , i guess we hate the <unk> . </s>
we hate to have a strong government . we have no trust in the system . </s>
and we should not have the healthcare system . </s>
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people . </s>
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us and <unk> itself to us that can afford . </s>
so , we &apos;re walking around and where we go from ? </s>
we run into the poor of the <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> . </s>
but you know , it &apos;s really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it . </s>
and i &apos;ve all seen all kinds of little things here . </s>
and i don &apos;t even know what -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s been in . </s>
and you know what ? when i say , screaming , yell me people who are saying , &quot; what do you do ? let me do it ? let people want to do what they want . </s>
so feel good . &quot; </s>
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong . </s>
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> that says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to accept the evidence of my senior &quot; or any <unk> , who &apos;s going to be <unk> with <unk> . </s>
if you &apos;re looking at that way , where do we think and magic lunch and science , you get to a place that you &apos;re not going to be . </s>
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa . </s>
he was 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , we can know that they were able to protect the course of aids . </s>
hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country that &apos;s worse than any other one of these disease . </s>
tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . </s>
they always have the same . </s>
now the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re now in the process is between the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> foods and the <unk> . </s>
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop . </s>
it &apos;s a debate about metaphors . </s>
science is ideology . </s>
all of the things we eat , each <unk> , every <unk> , has changed from people . </s>
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise . </s>
there was no <unk> . </s>
there was no <unk> . we did all the stuff . </s>
we did it in the last species . </s>
and it doesn &apos;t work with it . </s>
we &apos;re not working , &quot; well , we &apos;re afraid . </s>
now we can do it more than and of course , there &apos;s a lot of risks like this , but we can see something like this , and the stuff can help people help their lives . </s>
they don &apos;t want to do it ? </s>
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand . </s>
we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re doing a little bit of food . </s>
why do we do that ? </s>
now , what i &apos;m going to do is to hear a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want a huge amount of fields that &apos;s wrong . </s>
we don &apos;t want to do that , and do we do not much . </s>
we don &apos;t want companies to have any of them . </s>
and you know what my answer is to be ? </s>
you &apos;re right . we fix it . </s>
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science . </s>
this has nothing to do with science . </s>
it &apos;s quite morality , <unk> . </s>
you know , the science is not a company . </s>
she &apos;s not a country . </s>
it &apos;s not even a process . </s>
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear is a real function , and they &apos;re holding a real place , and they &apos;re holding a lot of human flourishing from the way . </s>
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll see 70 percent more food than the second world . 70 percent . </s>
this is the last 30 years . </s>
embarrassing . </s>
they don &apos;t need it . </s>
and why ? how to do it . </s>
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s a little billion people eat , which is a billion people eat . </s>
it &apos;s about a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s just a strands of calories . it &apos;s <unk> . </s>
it doesn &apos;t have a nutrients , it &apos;s not a protein , and scientists , all the things that just happened to be a bit . </s>
and then people will eat the food . </s>
they would not be <unk> , and you know what ? </s>
it would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice . </s>
and all of which i can say is , why is the fight we ? </s>
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight ? </s>
because we don &apos;t want to do genes ? </s>
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals . </s>
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our lack of our lack of food , better foods , overcome , mental foods . </s>
it &apos;s not about <unk> , it &apos;s about people alive , and it &apos;s very much time to preserve what that means . </s>
because , you know what ? </s>
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do that we continue to do something we do that we do something we do , i think , not guilty , high-tech . </s>
there is no other description of what &apos;s happening here . </s>
it &apos;s the selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s a ugly , and we really need to be really . </s>
so , after that incredibly funny conversation , you may say , &quot; you &apos;re still going to be in these ridiculous , and in the future ? &quot; </s>
anyway . i want to go on every case . </s>
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have a tremendous opportunity . </s>
we can take this particular , what we want to do . </s>
we can do it <unk> where we want them to be able to go and get them there , where we &apos;re going to go . </s>
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go back to the time , we &apos;ll be able to have the future to have done . </s>
i know that we can do it , and as it is free , it &apos;s a little bit that the world needs now . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
so for a few days , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it may strange that a magician is interested in it because , you know , &quot; a research that &apos;s going to be a little bit , if somebody &apos;s only going to be a little bit of a thing about it . &quot; </s>
in other words , <unk> have been shown to a <unk> impact , the <unk> , and that person is because the person thinks about it , for example , is a <unk> , or a kind of <unk> , is there a <unk> effect in the body that you call the <unk> . </s>
one deception is to learn something that is happening . </s>
so , we can also understand each other , i want you to show you a basic person in a very simple trick . </s>
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since every time in every care for children . </s>
i myself have been myself off the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the &apos; 70s . </s>
i &apos;m going to take him for you and explain it . </s>
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;ll explain him . </s>
so , you see what happens . </s>
the knife that you can study , my hand , my hand , the hand . </s>
i &apos;m going to hold the knife in my own way . </s>
i &apos;ve returned my sleeve . </s>
and so , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve was , or from my friend , i &apos;m just going to take my wrist right here . </s>
and in this way , you can see anything is going to be a lot of time , as long as i &apos;m here , you know , nothing in my sleeve . </s>
and the goal is just simply . </s>
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is good , the knife is by my naked physical <unk> . </s>
it actually is so that you actually have the <unk> that i can actually do it without the knife . </s>
nothing moves into my sleeve or come , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and they can &apos;t study anything . </s>
<unk> ! </s>
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> with little kids that are interested in magic , because you can learn much more about deception , but you can see it a very simple trick . </s>
probably , probably many of you here in the room . </s>
he &apos;s doing this : he &apos;s saying , &quot; he works . </s>
i think i &apos;m a knife in my hand . </s>
i say that i &apos;m my wrist <unk> , that nothing in my sleeve and my sleeve , and that &apos;s a lie . </s>
the reason i &apos;m my wrist , is the actual secret of illusion , that is that the real secret of illusion . </s>
and i think that moment where i &apos;m my hand from you , you move them from the back of the back of you , you move this finger from this , my favorite here , just where he was so , in a position . </s>
great ? </s>
there is someone who &apos;s no childhood . </s>
so , it &apos;s right . right . </s>
and when i was <unk> , i want to go to the fingers . </s>
and now you may talk about why this is a deception of why you don &apos;t even think that there are only three fingers of you , because the mind and the way it doesn &apos;t have information , one , two , three fingers , one , but they don &apos;t see it . </s>
but that &apos;s why not , you know , i &apos;m not going to be my hand and then i open my hand . </s>
of course , there &apos;s no body , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through the magnetism of body , which is now there &apos;s right now . </s>
and when i was my hand , i was going to be the same thing by that movement , and i &apos;m going to be through this movement that the fingers of the fingers . </s>
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife . </s>
thank you , you can see their friends and neighbors . thank you . </s>
well , what does it mean to do with the <unk> ? </s>
a year ago , or so i read a study that has been really quite frightening . </s>
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why for me one amazing thing . </s>
it turns out , if you took a placebo in a dummy placebo a dummy placebo a dummy placebo in a <unk> , in the form of a <unk> , white pill that has a particular effect that has a particular effect that has a particular effect that has a particular effect that has a particular effect that has a particular effect that has a particular effect that has a
but if you change the shape that the dummy placebo you create the dummy placebo into a smaller design , and this blue and a letters that has programmed it to be more effective . </s>
and that , though , though , though , they &apos;re just <unk> . </s>
but a white pill is not a way to explore a blue . </s>
what ? that &apos;s what i really freak out . </s>
it turns out that it &apos;s not all about . </s>
when you take capsules of capsules , the more effective than any shape . </s>
a colored capsule , which is yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule . </s>
the wireless plays a role . </s>
a pill twice a daily basis , not so much as i can do now to the most exciting statistic . i &apos;m sorry . </s>
but the key thing is , ... </s>
... also , the <unk> play a role . </s>
and the shape is a role . </s>
and when you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to get to the needle . </s>
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you &apos;re passionate about to a patient . </s>
it &apos;s a very strong picture in mind . that &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill . </s>
this is really -- i &apos;ll show you a different perspective , if we have a projector of a projector . </s>
so , the white pill would not be as potent as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t look like the blue pill that are not as well as a <unk> . </s>
and nothing really has made any really hopeful , it &apos;s just our faith that we &apos;re going to get into some effect . </s>
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick . </s>
i take a bit of a bit , which is obviously a deception , and let it really look really . </s>
we know from the trial you &apos;re going to get to the needle , if you go to the thing . </s>
this is a 18 inches long <unk> <unk> . she &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to get you a little bit of a little bit . </s>
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat . </s>
this is my favorite thing . this is not a special thing . </s>
i &apos;m going to take this needle into my skin and through them , and they drift up until they go on the other side . </s>
if you &apos;re going to happen -- if you &apos;re easy in -- i &apos;ve got a couple of friends in the hotel room night , and some people i don &apos;t know , and i didn &apos;t know , and yet , in a woman &apos;s . </s>
so i &apos;m proposing , if you will , will be <unk> , you look for the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to take the first component of the first time here . </s>
you can see it massively , but also , if you want to be , you want to be . </s>
so , it &apos;s so , right here , where my flesh starts to start the bottom part of my own , i just &apos;ll just make a little <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s crazy ? </s>
and now just a little bit of through my skin and on the other side of the same again . </s>
now we &apos;re actually the same situation we had to do that . </s>
it &apos;s about . </s>
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ? </s>
so i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , five , five . </s>
well , yes , you know , yes , yes , yes . </s>
i know what people think they are . </s>
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> itself to the skin , just for a few minutes . &quot; </s>
now , i &apos;m going to show you . </s>
what does this look like ? well , it &apos;s good . </s>
yeah , i know . </s>
and the people are saying , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t really see it right . &quot; </s>
now in the <unk> process in the <unk> . </s>
let me show you about the closeness of the closeness . </s>
this is really my skin . this is not a special thing . </s>
this is my meat , and i can do it . </s>
sorry . if you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , you &apos;re looking away , look , look . </s>
people are the ones who are the ones who eventually see the later and then say , &quot; well , it would be pretty accurate , but if it was really , &quot; well , if it was really , really , &quot; well , you really see , here &apos;s a hole and there it was really like , &quot; it would be really . &quot; </s>
okay , let me take you out of a little blood . </s>
yes , it &apos;s . </s>
i would take the needle . </s>
i &apos;d show my arm and show you that there are no wounds . </s>
but i think in this frame here , and it &apos;s what a <unk> thing to do something that i &apos;m going to go to the needle and so forth . </s>
we &apos;ll see a few times a few times . </s>
i hope you &apos;ve got a lot of stuff . </s>
everybody speaks about happiness . </s>
i &apos;ve been a few people who count with &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; in the last five years , and they commissioned it for about 40 and they gave them about 40 and more . </s>
there is a massive wave of the genetic variation on the other . </s>
there are a lot of <unk> . </s>
everybody would love to make people happier . </s>
but despite all of these wonders , there are several cognitive factors that make it possible impossible , clearly talks about happiness . </s>
and my talk today is mostly going to be a <unk> action . </s>
it &apos;s true for <unk> who &apos;s about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because of happiness , we are just so privileged to be able to get the way any way . </s>
the first one of these traps is a <unk> , complexity . </s>
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word because we &apos;re doing it on a lot of different things . </s>
i think there &apos;s a certain sense that we could actually be able to grow it , but in the big , that &apos;s something we need to give up and we will be the complicated view of what is happening . </s>
second case is a <unk> of experience and memory : it &apos;s basically a <unk> between happy living in his life and happy with his life . </s>
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the imagination of happiness . </s>
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the fact that we don &apos;t think about a fact that &apos;s well-being , without the meaning . </s>
i mean , this is a real cognitive community . </s>
there &apos;s just no way it &apos;s going to get right down . </s>
now i &apos;d like to start with a video clip from someone who was a <unk> , after my five lectures , who was absolutely <unk> , and it was absolutely beautiful , and it was absolutely beautiful , and it was absolutely beautiful , and it was absolutely beautiful , it was absolutely <unk> . </s>
and then he added it , really quite emotionally , that has been the whole experience of the whole experience . </s>
but that didn &apos;t happen . </s>
what it was like to have the memories of the experience . </s>
he had the experience of his own . </s>
he had 20 minutes to go . </s>
she didn &apos;t hurt because he was a reminder of <unk> ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was anything to get me to the buddha . </s>
what we really says that is that we think about us and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self . </s>
there is a <unk> self that lives in the present lives and the present is able to experience again , but fundamentally , the present has changed the present . </s>
it &apos;s the <unk> self , the doctor &apos;s <unk> -- you know , when the doctor said , &quot; do you know it &apos;s when i &apos;m wearing you here ? &quot; </s>
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the self itself is that the <unk> and the story of our life is the doctor and the story of our life by asking , and it &apos;s a doctor , how did you get to ? &quot; </s>
or &quot; how did you get albania ? &quot; or so similar . </s>
these are two very different units , the <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is part of the <unk> of happiness . </s>
now , the <unk> itself is a storyteller . </s>
and this is really what the fundamental response to our memories -- it starts to start . </s>
we &apos;re not only telling ourselves , when we do about it , telling us to tell stories . </s>
our memory tells us what we &apos;re doing is a story , which is the what we &apos;re doing is a story . </s>
and let &apos;s start with a example of an example . </s>
there &apos;s a old study . </s>
these are real patients that came to be a painful procedure . </s>
i &apos;m not going to go into detail . it &apos;s not painful , but it &apos;s painful when this was done in the 1990s . </s>
they were asked to report every 60 seconds of their pain . </s>
and here &apos;s two patients . these are their records . </s>
and they asked , &quot; who &apos;s been suffered by the one &apos;s more profitable ? &quot; </s>
and this is a very simple question . </s>
so , the b has got a lot more advanced . his <unk> was more <unk> , and every minute of pain who had a little bit of b , and more . </s>
but now there &apos;s a question of saying , &quot; how much thought that you &apos;re seeing ? &quot; </s>
and here &apos;s a surprise , a surprise . </s>
and the surprise is that a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , as a patient &apos;s ted had to be a leader . </s>
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very exciting part of history is how they did -- they were called the <unk> . </s>
and not that stories is very <unk> , or great -- but one of you are these clear ... </s>
but one of them is clear than the other . </s>
and the ones that are worse , where the pain was at the end of his peak was a bad story . </s>
how do we know that ? </s>
because we asked these people to their <unk> , and also a lot of later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot; </s>
and she was much worse for a <unk> in the <unk> . </s>
now , this is a direct relationship between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself . </s>
from the <unk> self , the <unk> had a <unk> time . </s>
now , what you could do with patient , and we actually have a clinical trials , and it &apos;s made up and it works , you could just be a <unk> of patient &apos;s tube and you &apos;re just working on the <unk> , you &apos;re simply going to evaluate it without a very <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s going to lead that the patient is because of the patient and a lot less than before . </s>
and if you do that , you know , the few minutes you do , that the <unk> itself is a lot better than you &apos;re a lot better than you &apos;re a little story about his experience , because you have a better history of a story about his own experience . </s>
what &apos;s a story about ? </s>
and that &apos;s true for the stories of us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent . </s>
it &apos;s a story of <unk> , <unk> , significant moments and end . </s>
but end up , very , very , very , very important and in this case . </s>
now , the <unk> itself alive . </s>
it has a lot of <unk> , one after the other . </s>
and they ask , what &apos;s happening with these moments ? </s>
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever . </s>
i mean , most of our life -- and i &apos;ve been seeing this -- you know , the psychological present , just about three seconds , and what does it mean , you know , in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 , in a month , most of you . </s>
most of you will totally be completely ignored by the <unk> . </s>
and yet , you get to the sense that you should count that what &apos;s happening during this is the most dynamic life of life . </s>
it &apos;s the virgin resource that we consume , we are using the same way that we are using . </s>
and how we consume them , but that &apos;s not the story that makes the <unk> itself for us . </s>
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> self and the <unk> itself , and they &apos;re really quite different . </s>
the biggest difference between them is the time . </s>
from the perspective of the <unk> itself , if you have a vacation , and the second week that is just twice as the first one , then the <unk> vacation twice as well as the average <unk> vacation . </s>
so , that &apos;s not the case for the <unk> itself . </s>
for the <unk> self , it doesn &apos;t look much better than the average holidays , because there are no new memories of memories because there are no new memories of memories because there are no new memories of memories because there are no new memories of memories because there are no new memories of memories because there are no new memories of memories because there are no new memories
they didn &apos;t change the story . </s>
and in this way , the critical thing is that a <unk> self is actually <unk> itself in a <unk> itself , very little impact on this story . </s>
now , the average self is doing more than just to remember and stories . </s>
it &apos;s actually the same thing that &apos;s choices , because if you have a patient , two different surgeons at two different surgeons , two different surgeons , two different surgeons , and that &apos;s the surgeon that the memory has been brought up less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s been going to be selected . </s>
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice . </s>
we &apos;re actually not supposed to choose between the world . we choose between memories of experiences . </s>
and even when we think about the future , we think about our future , not as we have experiences . </s>
we think about our future for memories . </s>
and basically , you can see the difference , as a person of the <unk> , and you can think of the <unk> themselves as one that &apos;s sort of <unk> self as one that &apos;s sort of <unk> itself through the experience of the self . </s>
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re doing it very often , we &apos;re going to be able to hold on the inside of the <unk> itself . </s>
and that &apos;s a little too difficult to justify . </s>
i mean , how much <unk> we do about our memories ? </s>
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of the <unk> themselves . </s>
and when i think about it , i think , in a vacation that was the best of the best march in antarctica , who we had ever made , the clearly of the best was to have ever had , and i think about that , i think , in other <unk> , how many times i think about other people . </s>
and i probably have probably from my memories to this journey , i would say about 25 minutes for 25 minutes , i would <unk> about 25 minutes for 25 years . </s>
now , if i take the folder , the most images i have been trying to have a more hour . </s>
now , these are three weeks , and they &apos;re <unk> a <unk> . </s>
there seems to be a moral language . </s>
well , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have to memories of memories of memories , but even if you make more of it , why we give memories of memories in the <unk> that we are going to give memories of the weight we are ? </s>
so i want you to think about a thought . </s>
imagine if you were to take their next vacation , you know , at the end of the <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug so that they will remember nothing . </s>
well , would you choose to choose ? </s>
and if you choose a different perspective between your own , there is a conflict between your own species , and you have to think about how they &apos;re doing this conflict , and they need to think about how they &apos;re doing this conflict , and if you think about the senses , you could think about the answer . </s>
why we &apos;re the <unk> , we &apos;re going to have a problem that we &apos;re now with a choice between the two species of self . </s>
now , the two ways of self is two terms of happiness . </s>
there &apos;s actually two concepts of the happiness that we can apply one of a per self . </s>
so , you can ask , how happy is the average self ? </s>
and then they &apos;d ask : how happy is the greatest living in life of the <unk> itself ? </s>
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a relatively complicated process . </s>
which are the emotions that can be measured ? </s>
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness itself over time . </s>
if you &apos;re looking for the happiness of the <unk> , it &apos;s a very different thing . </s>
it &apos;s not about happy a person . </s>
it &apos;s about how happy or sad person is when they &apos;re in their lives . </s>
very different term . </s>
anyone who &apos;s not using this research , and i &apos;m very , very much about the use of happiness , and i &apos;m learning to a lot of explorers of explorers on the right of the same kind of well-being in the same way that we have for the entire planet . </s>
the distinction between happiness itself , and the happiness itself has been detected in the last year , and now you &apos;re now experiencing the two <unk> . </s>
the gallup of a global scale has a worldwide million people who have been asked about their lives thinking about their lives and their experiences . and there were other efforts in direction . </s>
in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the self of self . </s>
and the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned , is they learned that they are really different . </s>
you can know how happy someone with his life is , and that teaches them , it really doesn &apos;t really matter how happy he lives and vice versa . </s>
just to give you a sense of the correlation that &apos;s about <unk> . </s>
and what that means is that if you go to somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ? </s>
now , she would know something about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . </s>
they have so much uncertainty . </s>
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s been life as eight as a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> himself . </s>
so the correlation is <unk> . </s>
we know something about what the happiness is determined . </s>
we know that money is very important . </s>
we know that happiness is mostly being happy to be happy with people that we like , time with people we like . </s>
there are other delight . </s>
so if you want to take the happiness of the self and they will do it very different things . </s>
and the conclusion of what i &apos;m saying here is that we really don &apos;t really think about it as a replacement replacement replacement . </s>
it &apos;s a completely different term . </s>
well , a very short reason that we don &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t think about happiness , we don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to think about the same things that we think about and if we live . </s>
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people get people in california they are not the case . </s>
if you ask that question , you think that people are going to be in california , when you &apos;re going to be in california , say , in ohio . </s>
and what &apos;s happening is that if you think about life in california , thinking about the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what we say , we say , in the climate . </s>
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the self itself is not even important for the <unk> itself , the magic of the <unk> , which is working . </s>
now because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could come up at the end -- some people would end up at the end . </s>
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to pursue the track of california in the hope of california in the hope of california . </s>
now , your <unk> will be happier . </s>
we know that . </s>
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , because if you think about it , you feel like the <unk> weather in ohio . and they &apos;ll feel like they &apos;re the right decision . </s>
it &apos;s very difficult to think of well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is . </s>
thank you . </s>
thanks to you . i have a question for you . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
now , when we did a couple of weeks ago , you have to tell me that there was a pretty interesting thing that i got to be able to poll . </s>
is that something that you can make us feel , because you &apos;re going to have a few minutes left now ? </s>
daniel <unk> : sure . </s>
i think the interesting result we &apos;ve found in the strange chain is a number that we did not find being found . </s>
we found this in terms of happiness itself . </s>
when we looked at the income , we have to have the income gene . </s>
and it turns out that under income income , for americans , and that &apos;s a very big deal of americans , about 600,000 dollars from americans , about 600,000 dollars , under a income of 600,000 dollars , from 600,000 dollars in the year . </s>
60,000 . </s>
<unk> : 60,000 . </s>
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;ll be more restrained , the poorer they will be poorer . </s>
we get a perfectly valid , and we get a perfectly valid . </s>
i &apos;ve seen rare as seen . </s>
what &apos;s happening is , obviously , is that money is not a <unk> heat , but lack of lack of money is certainly a frightening of money , and we can measure this very , very clear . </s>
in the other self , the <unk> itself , you get a different story . </s>
the more money you get more on the more . </s>
it &apos;s not true . </s>
but danny , in the entire american community , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness . </s>
when people take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seemed to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on . </s>
is there a chance to say that politicians , that the country has a <unk> like the serious <unk> and make it easier to politics ? </s>
<unk> : you know , i guess it &apos;s recognition for the role of the <unk> in politics . </s>
the recognition will be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the way , it &apos;s going to be a straight basis and in other countries , just in other countries . </s>
people are doing that , who should think of happiness should think of happiness when they think about politics . </s>
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are discussing the debate whether they want to study whether they want to study , so we have to get these discussion pretty soon . </s>
as you can see , can we depend on very differently , how they think about , and whether you think about the smartest yourself or whether you think about the average of thinking itself . </s>
that &apos;s politics , i think , in the years , in the years . </s>
in the united states , you feel to measure the <unk> of the population . </s>
this is going to happen , i think , in the next one , two decades of national statistics . </s>
well , it seems to me that this is going to be a subject , or should you need to be at least political years . </s>
thank you very much for the edges . </s>
thank you , danny <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m a leader . i was video games . </s>
i &apos;ve been banging now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is the next decade , it &apos;s just the world &apos;s going to save the world in <unk> . </s>
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time with the playing and <unk> games . </s>
currently currently currently spend three billion hours a week . </s>
some of you may think , &quot; well , that &apos;s a whole lot of time for games . &quot; </s>
perhaps something too much time when you solve how many problems we can have in the real world . </s>
but actually , my research is the future , the the opposite thing , the opposite . </s>
three billion hours per week is not nearly enough to solve the world . </s>
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive on this planet to survive , we have to have the time dramatically . </s>
i &apos;ve got basically realized that the needed was spent at 21 billion per week . </s>
and i think that seems like something spectacular , so i &apos;m finding it to be able to change that , if we &apos;re trying to change , play online , to give up more for at least 21 billion hours a week for at least 21 to end , play online . </s>
no , i really do it . </s>
why ? this picture is pretty much exactly why i believe that the games of human species in the future . </s>
this is a tudor of photographer <unk> . </s>
he wanted to do the feelings of the <unk> , so he &apos;s got a camera in front of the players . </s>
this is one of the big picture of the classical expressions . </s>
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the most powerful in this picture . </s>
you probably see this sense of urgency , something that &apos;s a little fear , but also , really focus , clearly in the pursuit of a real problem . </s>
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some of the most powerful ones that &apos;s up to the top of the <unk> eyes and the mouth of optimism surprise . </s>
this is a player that &apos;s the edge of a so-called <unk> . </s>
oh , you know , it &apos;s ok . we &apos;ve got some players here . so we &apos;ve got some players here . </s>
a <unk> victory is that the same thing is that the same thing didn &apos;t know before that was possible at all . </s>
it was a pretty good beyond the imagination . </s>
and if you get it , you know , they actually had to be able to be able to be able to get that it &apos;s a <unk> victory . </s>
this guy is a <unk> victory . </s>
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces around the world , if we take the barriers of the next century in the age of the next century in the margins of a <unk> <unk> . </s>
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we &apos;re difficult to meet problems . </s>
i refer to the fact that &quot; my bad life &quot; -- and it &apos;s actually my face , you see my face , you see ? ok . </s>
i &apos;m like , i &apos;m sick of the most <unk> thing . </s>
this is a <unk> in my recent home in berkeley , california , where i &apos;m in my 20s , california , where i &apos;m in the world . </s>
this is a problem that many players have been . </s>
we think we &apos;re not so good in the reality of reality . </s>
and i don &apos;t just have less successfully , even though that &apos;s just the time . </s>
we &apos;re getting into <unk> , i mean , i &apos;m good at the relationship with motivation , to do something more precise , inspired by the motivation . </s>
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think many of us evolved in our best version , and instantly the problem , the problem , the problem , the way to try to solve the <unk> again . </s>
and in reality , if we fail failure when we &apos;re failing on obstacles , we &apos;re often different . </s>
we feel we &apos;re looking at ourselves . we feel we &apos;re in the way we feel we feel like , depressed , frustrated , frustrated . </s>
these feelings we never , if you play games , you &apos;re just not going to be easy . </s>
and that &apos;s what i wanted to acknowledge as a magician . </s>
why is it impossible to think , to think , you couldn &apos;t just get anything to do anything ? </s>
how can we do this feelings from the play ? </s>
so i looked like a world of warcraft &apos;s warcraft that the ideals can make the ideals of the heart failure . </s>
and i found some things that epic young grandchildren in <unk> so possible . </s>
so , first of all , if you &apos;re in one of the most remote <unk> , especially in latin america , there are lots of different characters that are ready to give you a <unk> mission , and it &apos;s instantly for a <unk> mission . </s>
but not only one mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to the <unk> level of the game in the game . </s>
so , they do that . </s>
she never get a task that can &apos;t solve . </s>
but always , they need to be a lot of their skills , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft . </s>
you don &apos;t sit down and see it &apos;s very important to do so well . there &apos;s a lot of things done . </s>
and there &apos;s plenty of collaborators . </s>
also , they go to hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to work with the young mission . </s>
we don &apos;t have the true life of the emotion that we &apos;re not so simple , that at the heart of a <unk> . </s>
and furthermore , there &apos;s this epic story that &apos;s inspiring this inspiring story that we &apos;re seeing . </s>
then we get this whole positive feedback . </s>
they have determined from &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; + strength , &quot; or &quot; + 1 &quot; + intelligence . &quot; </s>
this is not true of the true feedback . </s>
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a <unk> and a fantasy , and the inventor crazy idea , the <unk> of a crazy idea . </s>
i &apos;m getting ready to get this feedback . </s>
so , the problem of the most potent thing is that it &apos;s so potent to warcraft , it &apos;s so potent that it &apos;s so potent to be a <unk> , we rather than all of our time in this <unk> . </s>
they &apos;re just better than reality . </s>
so , in today , all the world have spent <unk> million years to solve problems of <unk> million years of solving . </s>
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing . </s>
it sounds like , it sounds . </s>
but to see it in context , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> of <unk> . </s>
so the first day . </s>
ok , so if we talk about it , how much time we currently do with play , is that the only sense of human beings , when you &apos;re looking at the scale of human development , the <unk> of human affairs is going to be a bit . </s>
but also , it &apos;s appropriate . because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time , by the way , in fact , the change we are in the situation , actually , what we are as humans in the situation . </s>
we &apos;re developing to understand , just creature . </s>
this is the truth . i believe . </s>
and look at this interesting , the next researcher was published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average boy , boy in a country with <unk> <unk> spends <unk> 10,000 hours of the 21st of the 21st </s>
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two , a few reasons . </s>
first of all , for kids in the united states hours that they spend the exact <unk> of high school that you spend in school in school , from the fifth grade . </s>
so we have a complete <unk> , on the young people , which means what it means to be a good player , like anything they learn in school . </s>
and maybe some of you have some of you in malcolm gladwell , <unk> , read , read , read . </s>
so you know , you know , your theory is the theory of the success , the theory of the success of the world . </s>
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> , that if we spent 10,000 hours of a piece of wood , to the 21st of a 21st century , we &apos;ll master it . </s>
we &apos;re going to be doing good at what &apos;s also doing people like the most important people in the world . </s>
so what we &apos;ve here is , is a full generation of young people who are <unk> . </s>
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players &apos;s <unk> <unk> ? &quot; </s>
because if we could figure that out , we could never get there before the potential of human potential . </s>
so many people have been around the world that at least a hour a day of an hour a day . </s>
these are our <unk> . 500 million people , the age of that are good at &quot; what are the exceptional good at &quot; what &apos;s the age of &quot; something &quot; . &quot; </s>
and in the next decade , we have another billion of gamers that are always good in whatever . </s>
if you haven &apos;t heard it , you know , if you haven &apos;t heard . </s>
the <unk> <unk> , the energy consumption and working on <unk> , instead of india , in india , in india , in india , china , brazil . </s>
you can get a extra billion player in the next decade . </s>
we have a total billion player . </s>
so i started thinking about what it is to do with us that games do . </s>
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , <unk> . </s>
ok , you can imagine that the <unk> <unk> . </s>
<unk> is desire to do something , a kind of hurdle , a hurdle , a hurdle , together with the belief that we have a medical school on success . </s>
but the reason i believe is that a <unk> victory can be done , and that it &apos;s worthwhile to try and see it , and it &apos;s a minute , it &apos;s a minute , and it &apos;s a minute , it &apos;s going to be a minute , and it &apos;s a minute , it &apos;s going to be a minute , and it &apos;s a minute ,
players don &apos;t sit around . </s>
we &apos;re masters in the spiders of poet , social nets . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that we &apos;re like , more than we are playing with them , even if they defeated us . </s>
the reason for that is that there is a lot of trust , with someone playing a game . </s>
we trust that somebody &apos;s time with us that the rules will be <unk> that we have the same goal and to stay on the <unk> . </s>
so , this is the <unk> ratio of ties , trust and each other . </s>
as a consequence , we &apos;re building the hundreds of social relationships . </s>
productivity ! productivity . </s>
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 22 days , as a <unk> . </s>
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re happier to work hard to work hard when we relax about it , and if we relax about it , or anything else . </s>
we know that we are as human beings , if we were hard to be significant , significant significant . </s>
and player is always a lot of task when they get the right thing . </s>
and ultimately , epic matters . </s>
players love it to be part of <unk> missions of <unk> missions . </s>
here &apos;s a <unk> to the right light on the right light , and you know , all of wikipedia , the most famous acts of the world . </s>
the second largest western world , with almost 80,000 <unk> , the world of warcraft . </s>
five million people are doing every month . </s>
they &apos;ve got more information about world warcraft in the internet , as a whole other country in every other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in any other way in
they created a epic story . </s>
they created a epic source of knowing about the world &apos;s world . </s>
ok , so these are four superpowers to lead the only superpowers . it &apos;s <unk> , hopeful individuals . </s>
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world . </s>
and the only thing is that they believe , you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real . </s>
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve . </s>
edward <unk> is a <unk> . </s>
his work is great . he &apos;s talking about why people have time , energy and money laundering . </s>
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not less <unk> as a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot; </s>
and so he &apos;s logical . </s>
and he says , he says ... </s>
not as i ... i &apos;m playing , i &apos;m playing a little more <unk> . </s>
so he says , it actually makes sense , because players can achieve in <unk> more than in real life . </s>
they can be more social bonds than in real life , as opposed to the real life , they get more of more feedback and rewards in play than real life . </s>
so , he says it &apos;s logical so much that the players are more than in the middle of the physical network . </s>
i &apos;m not even thrilled that it &apos;s logical . </s>
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> . </s>
we need to start to turn the real world into a game . </s>
my inspiration comes from a event that &apos;s called the 2,500 years . </s>
there &apos;s this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ? </s>
fantastic <unk> , it was <unk> . </s>
and these were sort of people <unk> , <unk> . </s>
and when you &apos;re familiar with the patent holders of the ancient greek <unk> , you may know , maybe this story . the story about how games and why games have been invented . </s>
according to <unk> , games were more closely , <unk> , in the kingdom of the famine during a famine . </s>
there was such a such famine famine that the king of <unk> came to a crazy idea . </s>
people are getting more . </s>
it was a extremes situation . </s>
so they created , according to the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> court , and she would have a national strategy to eat . </s>
and they would be so much in the <unk> cloud , because the <unk> are so fascinating and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , they would forget about eating . </s>
and then the next day would be eating . and the next day would be eating . </s>
and according to <unk> , they took this famine for 18 years , by having a day and the next line . </s>
and i think , let &apos;s play a bit . </s>
we &apos;re using games to <unk> the world . </s>
we &apos;re using games to try to get everything that &apos;s in real world , especially life in real life , especially life is not a lot of us to play what we need . </s>
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . </s>
that &apos;s exciting . </s>
according to 18 years , after 18 years was not better , so he decided to <unk> the king , a <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
she shared in two <unk> . </s>
she played a <unk> and the <unk> to a <unk> adventure . </s>
she goes on the left and made it to a new home . they were just so many people , and they were just so many people , and we were just seeing as many people , and he &apos;s going to bring them back to the rest of a neighborhood . </s>
it sounds crazy , right ? </s>
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> that came out of the deep empire empire , the same dna as the old <unk> . </s>
so , recently , scientists came to the notion that <unk> is actually true story . </s>
and geologists was a global <unk> that almost 20 years , which could be almost like the famine years of all . </s>
so this crazy story . </s>
you may actually have people their people through their play , they have 18 years in games and then they have this <unk> and so much about the other one learned that they learned from civilization . </s>
so , we can also see that . </s>
we &apos;re in 1994 for 1994 . </s>
this was the first <unk> in real time of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s first 16 . </s>
she played 18 years of <unk> , we &apos;ve been warcraft for 16 years . </s>
i &apos;m going to claim our own <unk> play . </s>
so they shipped half their civilization on the quest to a new world . so that &apos;s why i take my 21 billion <unk> a week . </s>
we should be able to think that half of us had a hour a day with them playing , until we have the problems of the real world . </s>
i know , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in play ? &quot; and this is exactly the question i &apos;ve got my work in the last year at the time of the future . </s>
we have this banner in palo alto , it &apos;s the way we should understand the future . </s>
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before . </s>
what we want to do is to create the future . </s>
we want to introduce the best outcome , and then people empower people to empower them , that &apos;s what they do . </s>
we think we &apos;re young grandchildren and giving people who are the opportunities to get them . </s>
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about three games that i &apos;ve been designed to try to give people young people in their own future . </s>
it &apos;s &quot; the oil . &quot; </s>
game is 2007 . </s>
it &apos;s a <unk> that you need to overcome a <unk> . </s>
the <unk> is , but we &apos;ve got enough <unk> to the <unk> , but we have ample <unk> to you , and you have to figure out where they live , and they get to be able to figure out how much oil is going to be , and you have to figure out how much the most important life is without oil . so , if you ask
we have this game with a lot of players in the year , and we have been working since the last three years . </s>
and i can tell you , it was a sense of it . </s>
no one wants to change your life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should . </s>
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , and i &apos;m saying , &quot; we go out . &quot; </s>
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go . </s>
find out how they would survive . most of our players have the most important players in the game . </s>
so we &apos;ve taken the next <unk> game , bigger goal , higher goal , more powerful goal than just <unk> . </s>
we have the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the time . </s>
and the calculation of a <unk> that people only have lived on the planet . </s>
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; which of course . </s>
the call to be described , we have almost like a <unk> <unk> . </s>
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s &quot; <unk> , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , the <unk> and only the world can save the world . </s>
but in our game , instead of just five people say , we &apos;re in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , health , and the future of social justice . </s>
8,000 , the game was telling you about eight weeks . </s>
they found 500 solutions that you can read them when they &apos;re going to be a &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
and the last game we get on , in the third march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank . </s>
if you get the game , it &apos;s the world bank , the <unk> , it &apos;s 2010 . </s>
we &apos;re working with universities in the store and they store it to learn a social worker . </s>
we have a comic book . we have a level of <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , and ingenuity and ingenuity . </s>
i want to encourage you all to share with young people all over the world , all over the world , particularly in <unk> , who benefit from where their own social enterprises . </s>
i &apos;ll come back to the end . </s>
i want to ask you . </s>
so , you think about the next thing ? </s>
we have all these fantastic players we can show us what we can do , but we have the real world yet . </s>
well , i hope that you agree in that agree that are human resources that we can actually use it in real life , and that &apos;s a great meaning for change . </s>
we &apos;ve set up this whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , who is ability to get tight <unk> , <unk> , and the desire to make meaning . </s>
i hope really , we really can play together in order to survive another century . </s>
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this and play . </s>
when i &apos;m going to talk to the next decade , i &apos;m going to be a certain number of things : that we can create a role future , and we all kind of the other games . </s>
so let &apos;s start shedding the <unk> games ! </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;d like to tell you something i &apos;d like to write a few months ago a day . </s>
i always sit down my <unk> , but i was with the one of the who &apos;s ready to see and i noticed that i &apos;ve never done in my life , which means that the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means . </s>
i read you about the post . </s>
&quot; disabled &quot; , &quot; <unk> , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
<unk> : it &apos;s a lot of , left . </s>
i have this list of a friend of mine and to follow , and to follow it , it was so ridiculously that i was going to read &quot; &quot; and couldn &apos;t read anymore , and i was just to read and learn to me to this <unk> <unk> and the <unk> . </s>
of course , the <unk> , <unk> , i just thought that the output was pretty much old the copy already . </s>
but in fact , there was a braille edition of a <unk> , and when i was working with school , my real child , and to form my economic <unk> of my public health and shapes and the rest of the world around me . </s>
and god thank you so much , i use a <unk> . </s>
i would seriously take this seriously seriously , i &apos;m born in a world that someone would be like me as a person in a high way , but today i &apos;m going to take for the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced , and i &apos;ve been experiencing for the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced . </s>
so i got to see the <unk> of 2009 and i expected to find a <unk> white thing . </s>
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> . </s>
unfortunately , they don &apos;t have much better . </s>
and especially i was troubled by the last two words under &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; healthy &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; healthy . &quot; </s>
but it &apos;s not just the words . </s>
it &apos;s about the people think we can think about this words . </s>
it &apos;s about the values that we &apos;re going to do , and how we &apos;re doing these values . </s>
our language affect our language , and how we see the world and the people around us . </s>
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the romans , they really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> has been a huge force because what you &apos;re noisy , is <unk> . </s>
so , what do we actually want to do -- a human people or a million people , or a democrat people ? </s>
in fact , a person &apos;s trained to call a child , could be able to call them up . </s>
it wouldn &apos;t be beautiful to open up ? </s>
a man who has been served for me for me , was my pediatrician at the <unk> institute in <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , which is why you can think , most americans are not going to be accurate and then he got dr. <unk> . </s>
and dr. always always wore <unk> and <unk> and was working with children , how did we have the work with children . </s>
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> . </s>
i had to draw up with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that &apos;s where my <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s my <unk> -- that &apos;s my <unk> -- i &apos;ve got it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . </s>
and i think , actually , as a <unk> child , with dr. p. <unk> , and so , to try to stop this , <unk> without success . </s>
and one day he was approached me at one of my favorite exercises -- these <unk> , and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re a strong , &quot; and he said , &quot; wow , you &apos;ll get a strong , &quot; you &apos;ll be a strong , &quot; you &apos;ll be able to start one day . </s>
and if you take it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollar . &quot; </s>
this was just a simple trick by dr. p. <unk> , so i don &apos;t want to do with the chance of doing my daily eye in the second , but he actually made me to see my daily <unk> in the second . and so he was actually able to see my daily life . </s>
and i &apos;m looking today , how much vision of me as a cheese girl from me as a powerful and girl young my colleague , and i could imagine as a sort of nature from strong and <unk> . </s>
this is just a example of many , how adults could be a child mortality of a child labor . </s>
but what the research <unk> examples of the <unk> , makes us something like our language , something imagine what we all want to do , it causes each other to allow people to see themselves as a person as a person . </s>
our language <unk> the social change in many cases through a technological changes through a technological changes through a technological change . </s>
from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , of course , that my legs , the <unk> <unk> for <unk> , <unk> from titanium and <unk> for the basis of titan that are capable of titanium and <unk> with the world that have their natural identity , which is to itself . </s>
so , perhaps this technological change is the technological change that there is always already a truth , which is that every human being can be able to do something very much and very surprising and very powerful and very powerful and very powerful and that the human ability is plus our biggest plus our biggest plus . </s>
the human ability to adapt -- this is a interesting story , because people always ask me to , i always understand a little , like i &apos;m going to show you a little , that sentence to answer the people , and i &apos;m going to see a little , i &apos;m going to see why . </s>
this sentence from the idea of the notion that is true , that success or luck to be able to master a challenge , without the way that my life is so successful , or whatever my life was to make a challenge , or whatever my life could be , or whatever people feel like me . </s>
but the truth is that we change ourselves . we &apos;re going to change the challenge , whether you &apos;re physically physically , emotionally whether you &apos;re physically , emotionally , emotionally both , is a real thing . </s>
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good . </s>
<unk> are no obstacle that we need to be better to come to our lives better . </s>
we just get a living thing . </s>
and i tend to see the shadow of my shadow . </s>
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very close to see , sometimes he hardly see hardly , but he &apos;s all me . </s>
and i want to do that the impact of a human being human beings , in a human <unk> . </s>
there are a lot of <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just real <unk> and every person and every person and the question is not whether we &apos;re not going to come with <unk> , but the question is not whether we can . </s>
so , we &apos;re not just responsible for that we love to keep people who we love to preserve , but it &apos;s also looking for it to come well . </s>
and we don &apos;t have our kids to feel like if we feel like you can &apos;t adapt . </s>
you have to separate things clear : to a medical fact , to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , or not . </s>
and to be honest with the only real disability and the disability that i had to sit apart , that the world was constantly , they could be able to describe me with this definitions . </s>
in our desire to protect people that are at the heart of hearts , and you can imagine the very cold to the quality of the quality of the world &apos;s going to the quality of the quality of the world , that is actually not going to be disabled . </s>
perhaps the current concept that just accommodates it is just what is a broken , and how we fix the fix , a larger disability than the <unk> . </s>
if we &apos;re not treat a human , and not all of his forces and opportunities and further and further and argue , we can make the natural struggle that you may have to lead . </s>
we &apos;re <unk> a human value , which has a value for our society . </s>
so we have to focus on the <unk> of human possibilities and all of human possibilities . </s>
but the other thing that it &apos;s between perception and our great <unk> , one connection . </s>
we should not try and do this <unk> times , or no doubt , we should try and avoid them , but we should be under the rug of the rug , but it &apos;s about to recognize the <unk> opportunities . </s>
it may be like that we don &apos;t necessarily think of that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of the need to get us , but we &apos;re going to use them to make them also , but to dance . </s>
and perhaps we can do it , <unk> as a little natural gas and useful and useful and useful and feel like this . </s>
in this year , we celebrate the 200 , anniversary of charles darwin , and when he 150 years ago , he &apos;s darwin , in my eye , in my eye , in fact , in my eye . </s>
i &apos;d like to do it so that &apos;s not the most powerful of his <unk> , and also not the <unk> of his way , but the one that changes best . </s>
from conflict . </s>
not only darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to the ability to survive and <unk> , from the battle of human spirit . </s>
so , again , the most fundamental skill of human beings , in the human , . </s>
and perhaps we know , we &apos;re just going to be a fusion unless we &apos;re really going to be really sensitive . </s>
perhaps the sense of <unk> , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own force . </s>
we can overcome something like this . </s>
we can give a new meaning to the heavy times more than times . </s>
perhaps we can see <unk> as change . </s>
and so , for a change we &apos;re not adapted to have adapted . </s>
i think the biggest one is the biggest of the harm that we &apos;re supposed to be normal , is that we &apos;re supposed to be normal . </s>
it &apos;s normal ? </s>
there is no normal . </s>
there &apos;s the usual usual . but not the usual thing , and they would learn this poor , you really know , you really want to learn when it really wants to be really , really , if you really needed ? </s>
i think , not . </s>
it would be great if we fly this paradigm against another possibility of the possibility of the possibility to create a little more efficient , and they &apos;re going to invite their own special and valuable skill to society and skill to society . </s>
<unk> found that we humans have to be human society from the members of the time , useful and a contribution . </s>
there are evidence that the neanderthals were formed 60,000 people and the most people with heavy physical injuries of ants , and that &apos;s what the most <unk> in the <unk> of this man is to be the best for the society . </s>
they didn &apos;t have these people as they were useless and they were considered something called a special and valuable . </s>
a few years ago , i was in the city i was going to grew up in a <unk> in the city of pennsylvania , in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there before a <unk> tomato sauce . </s>
it was summertime , and i had <unk> . </s>
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if you don &apos;t know , &quot; well if it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot; </s>
and i was looking around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is . </s>
and i said , &quot; excuse me , you know , we know , i &apos;m not going to remember them . &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; well , you can barely remember me . </s>
when i saw them , i was going to get them out of the belly of your mother . &quot; </s>
oh , so the one . </s>
and of course , it &apos;s made up . </s>
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i just came out of my mom &apos;s day because i knew , i knew , quite a birthday , i knew , to my birthday . </s>
the doctor for <unk> , my mom was in vacation , and so my parents had my parents who brought me to the world that i was invited to the world . </s>
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet , after you , and i just got a couple of toes at this and some toes at this point , he had to the <unk> , this guy had to give the bad news . </s>
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to say , &quot; they never walk , and never so much as other kids or you can never have a mental life or you can never have a mental life . &quot; </s>
so i found that he used to <unk> my entire childhood bank in the second of the class , whether i had this <unk> in the second person , whether i had this <unk> in the second world , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school , <unk> medical school and <unk> medical school . </s>
and he called this part of his <unk> to the x , the potential of human . </s>
you can &apos;t be able to think how important that factor for the quality of life of a human being . </s>
and dr. <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if you don &apos;t know anything , and even if they get a little bit , and even if you get a little bit , you can get kids , then , children can achieve children , then they can achieve children . &quot; </s>
look , dr. <unk> has changed . </s>
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody has been about to have two different things . </s>
and i &apos;m thinking my thinking in the course of time when they were in my age 15 years old and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second <unk> to my legs and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second <unk> . </s>
i wanted to get normal <unk> . </s>
if you &apos;re wondering , i &apos;m not sure . </s>
and this is what happened , because i &apos;ve been messing with my legs and not even though it . </s>
and perhaps that change also , because i &apos;m so many people , i &apos;m able to have to have a lot of people who have been interested in love with me or to give me a sense of <unk> . </s>
you see it really just a human being , who tells you how they can <unk> their powers , and they are through . </s>
if you &apos;re a person , your own , is to activate forces , like , the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can do this , and for someone in a critical moment , a door , then they are a very good teachers . </s>
they &apos;re going to open up with a doors . </s>
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
it means something like that in a way , the potential <unk> . </s>
again : we want to do the model ? </s>
in britain was in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , <unk> in <unk> . </s>
she called the &quot; <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call the &quot; <unk> &quot; in the united states . </s>
students will be <unk> . </s>
and the students are getting harder to be able to do the better teachers , and the better teachers are getting worse . </s>
they have a <unk> period of paper with a &quot; <unk> &quot; note , &quot; it was told you , you know , they were told you would be very clever . and after three months , they wrote very clever . </s>
and of course , it &apos;s a way of course , that the <unk> was told that the <unk> was told . </s>
and it was , in three months . </s>
but only those who still have been in school , except from the students who had the <unk> . </s>
so , in this trial , the teachers was not <unk> . </s>
the teachers didn &apos;t know anything . </s>
they simply got that , that &apos;s the <unk> and that are the students who are the students with enough fever and so they taught you . </s>
the only real disability is a <unk> ghost mind that has been broken , and it has been brought up , no hope of the natural history of natural history , providing <unk> and our <unk> capacity of imagination . </s>
but if we manage it to support the human mind to help hope itself and other people around , and other people are beautiful about to find them , and then we put our forces really positive to a positive way . </s>
if a spirit , that we can have this qualities , we can actually create a new reality and new <unk> . </s>
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet named <unk> in the 14th century , and i &apos;m going to talk about my friend and told me , &quot; every child knows , he &apos;s only four words , not just come true , dance with me . &quot; </s>
come on me . thank you very much . </s>
how would you want to be better than you are ? </s>
so , i suppose , by the way , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory , more than , and faster . </s>
or they want to have more power , more force , more force . </s>
they want to be attractive ? </s>
how about life , to live ? </s>
or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who always wondered more creativity . </s>
what would you do most of us ? </s>
which would you like to have one of these things ? </s>
creativity . </s>
how many people would choose to see creativity ? </s>
raise your hands . let me see me . </s>
a couple of . probably as many as people here are creative people here . </s>
it &apos;s very good . </s>
how many would you choose to decide ? </s>
so , a few more . </s>
how about fitness ? </s>
some of them . </s>
what is the longevity with longevity ? </s>
ah , the majority . that &apos;s <unk> i like a doctor . </s>
if you have one of these , it would be a whole different world . </s>
all right ? </s>
or is it possible to be able to do ? </s>
evolution is a <unk> issue here on the ted conference here , but today i want to give you the one of the bacteria . </s>
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , who had nothing to do with the title , in the title of evolution . &quot; </s>
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t have the proof of biological evolution , this is a very good at a very good time , take you your personal <unk> -- you may find your personal <unk> -- you may find the way that &apos;s going to be wrong , because nothing of course , that &apos;s what makes you to do their personal sense for
but if you accept biological evolution , you think it &apos;s just about the past , or the same thing about the past , or it &apos;s about the future ? </s>
is it for other people &apos;s work or anything else it &apos;s ? </s>
this is a true view of life . </s>
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the margins of life in the front of the tops of life that have survived in the very first place , all the <unk> , all of the <unk> : it has survived and starches . </s>
the human portion of this <unk> , is the end of the end , of course , is that we are most interested in most interest . </s>
we &apos;re going to be a common ancestor to modern ancestor about six or eight million years ago . </s>
in this period , there was 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids . </s>
some of these are come . </s>
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years here . </s>
it seems like we were quite rightly , from the other parts of life , but actually , the greatest part , the basic mechanisms are mechanisms our cells . </s>
now , you know , we can pull out of that , and the dna of a shared bacteria can be able to use a sense of human <unk> of human <unk> , which is using the <unk> of the human brain disorder . </s>
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically from the pancreas of what &apos;s called . </s>
and we already talk about bacteria , is to tell you that everyone is going to be more bacteria than it does more bacteria than it does cells ? </s>
maybe 10 times a time . </s>
my guess is , you know , if you ask the antonio damasio , you think about the bacteria , thinking about the bacteria ? </s>
our gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for these bacteria . </s>
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s a very comfortable . </s>
and you &apos;re all nutrients that you could not want to wish to you , not just want to do some effort . </s>
it &apos;s really a lighter way of bacteria , with the occasional supreme of bacteria , <unk> forced . </s>
but you &apos;re also a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives . </s>
they &apos;re at the local table of <unk> . and they protect them against certain kinds of diseases . </s>
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ? </s>
is we &apos;re in a kind of <unk> balance in a species of <unk> ? </s>
or are we going to be able to get something else to be more than that maybe you may be adapted to the environment . </s>
let &apos;s go back to the time of 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the earth , about four billion years ago -- the earth , about four billion years ago -- and then the human species that went to about four billion years ago -- and then the human species that went into the past . </s>
in this huge view of the universe , the life on earth is just a very short , very short , like a single <unk> , and the human life , a little <unk> . </s>
we were . </s>
and this is also the most exciting thing that talk about , i hope d up to you , d . </s>
now when i was a <unk> on college , i had my first <unk> . </s>
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology . </s>
i fell in my mind in evolution , and i posed something very , very , very much , in most of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information will continue to grow in . </s>
but at the time , as a <unk> act , the things change . </s>
cheap reproduction , the picture of the picture . </s>
and very important , the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is the genome that will be the rest of the body . </s>
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of our bodies is in evolution at the same time , the sexual reproduction . </s>
now i have to confess , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex , sex -- it seemed quite reasonable to the one at the time , but with every year , it seemed to be a child . </s>
i came to the feelings of george burns that show us in las vegas show in the 1990s . </s>
and one night on a <unk> . </s>
he opens the door . </s>
he &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot; </s>
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot; </s>
i came to the conclusion of the physician as a doctor &apos;s goal that i was in evolution was the goal of evolution -- not necessarily -- not necessarily the goal . </s>
i tried to keep the body . </s>
i was trying to do healthy . </s>
i wanted to give the health to a disease . </s>
i wanted to live a long and healthy healthy life . </s>
evolution is all about the most important thing about the next generation , and most generation for generation . </s>
from a very simple point , you &apos;re and i like <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> to send the genetic level of orbit to send the genetic level of going to the sea . </s>
i think we would all have the mood that woody provided all the way to the <unk> , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get to the work of my work . </s>
i want to die by doing . &quot; </s>
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily be the longest . </s>
it doesn &apos;t necessarily get necessarily <unk> the best , or the fastest , and not even the smartest the brightest . </s>
evolution <unk> the creatures that are best at best . </s>
it &apos;s just the test of survival and the success of the time and the success of success and success . </s>
in the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are bacteria and enable the hot spots and enable the hot spots to the first place if there were vacuum otherwise , and fish were able to have a <unk> environment for themselves . </s>
so , what does that mean when we think about what evolution is going to happen , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and we think that there &apos;s a number of opportunity to say that there is a number of opportunity . </s>
the first one is that we can &apos;t be . </s>
we &apos;ve reached a equilibrium equilibrium . </s>
and the reason for that would be , it &apos;s been given us by medicine , has a lot of genes to preserve otherwise that otherwise <unk> , and that &apos;s the population removed from the population . </s>
and second , we have a species of us to ensure our environment that we adapt to us is that we adapt to us , we adapt to adapt to adapt to adapt to adapt to adapt to adapt to adapt . </s>
and by the way , we wander , and we &apos;re so much that they can &apos;t tell you that isolation , that isolation is necessary to evolution , for evolution to evolution . </s>
one is a second possibility that is a evolution of the traditional way of course , of course , is the nature of nature . </s>
and the argument that the wheels is slowly , but they are <unk> . </s>
and so far isolation , if we &apos;re faced as a species of planet , it &apos;s going to be the case and the changes of the environment , the evolution of evolution is producing evolution . </s>
but there is a third opportunity to a <unk> , fascinating and <unk> possibility . </s>
i call it <unk> -- the new development that are not simply , of course , but the reason and decided of us as a <unk> in the decisions we make . </s>
now , how could it happen ? </s>
how could it be possible to be able to do that ? </s>
let &apos;s look at the reality that people today in some cultures have to be done about their offspring . </s>
they &apos;re in some cultures , the choices , to have more men than women . </s>
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what it is that the one and the family &apos;s going to do . </s>
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose your child to the child &apos;s gender of their child , and the body genetic <unk> are diseases and <unk> . </s>
what if they could genetic genetic change , to make diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease or alzheimer &apos;s disease
you wouldn &apos;t want to do it in their genes ? </s>
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kind of changes are going to be possible . </s>
the real genome is in 1990 , and it took 13 years . </s>
it &apos;s $ <unk> billion dollars . </s>
in the following year when it was done , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> , to four million months . </s>
today , you can see a sequence of the three billion dollars in a price of about dollars in about a week , and in the room of about a week . </s>
it &apos;s not going to take more long , until the reality of human genomes will give it the 1,000 dollars , and it will be increasingly available for everyone available to everyone . </s>
one week ago , we launched the national academy of engineering <unk> for francis <unk> and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who are doing the natural prize of evolution , faster to work in a <unk> way -- which is <unk> arnold faster and <unk> proteins . </s>
a few years was to <unk> <unk> <unk> shares the scientists for his research on his research in his <unk> , a <unk> , and through only four genes of only four , a cell phone , and by the manipulation of just four genes -- a cell potentially , a cell potentially . </s>
these changes are in the middle . </s>
same technology that makes human insulin in bacteria that are not protection by itself , but also to also have a medical viruses to serve other viruses . </s>
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in the gang with a experimental <unk> in the cells of a <unk> . </s>
can you picture a little bit of good , that &apos;s made of tobacco ? </s>
this is all reality and in fact , much more possible . </s>
now , you know , two different little things about . </s>
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their descendants ? </s>
what if you could drive the sperm and <unk> or the fresh fresh egg could be a better chance to give your kids to give their kids a better chance to give the risk of cancer cells . </s>
who wouldn &apos;t be like children ? </s>
and then the analytical technique , the same engine of science is the changes of science disease , could also enable us to create the <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory . </s>
why not have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the <unk> ? </s>
why not the fast <unk> that enable them to be able to walk faster and longer ? </s>
why not life ? </s>
these are going to be <unk> . </s>
and if we &apos;re a place that we can be able to pass it to the next generation , and we can make the attributes of the data that we want to be , we will be <unk> by <unk> evolution of evolution . </s>
we &apos;re going to have a process that &apos;s underway in the rule of 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even upside-down to the next 100 years . </s>
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , will be . </s>
using this choice is that we can make this decisions that is more successful , the more successful is the more successful ? </s>
or are we going to choose different attributes of the attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ? </s>
are we going to be a society and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ? </s>
these are the kinds of questions we need to be able to address . </s>
and most of all , we &apos;re able to be able to be able to be able to be able to build wisdom and the wisdom and wisdom we are going to make this decisions ? </s>
in the good position , and they used to think about , as you may think they &apos;re decisions , they &apos;re decisions that decisions we are . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want you to imagine a portable robot that you can drive skills to the <unk> skills , or another one that helps to go and go back and go back and go . </s>
we call berkeley <unk> , this robot . </s>
they &apos;re not doing anything else that they go in the morning and they &apos;re going to increase the extra power and the death toll and the death toll is going to help you for the balance . </s>
this is actually the true community of human and machine . </s>
but not only that -- so that &apos;s what they do and connect them to the universe . </s>
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea . </s>
and to show you now , we start working with the american soldiers , the american soldiers , the average soldier , about 100 pounds on his level , and it &apos;s a very simple thing that they &apos;re wearing more . </s>
of course , this is true to some extent -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> . </s>
so we thought we would take this challenge to embrace and a <unk> , which is what we could do with this issue . </s>
so let me introduce you now <unk> -- or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
soldier : i can write 200 pounds of <unk> terrain , many of them long , for many hours . </s>
his flexible is enabling to go to a deep , and highly highly <unk> movements . </s>
it feels like i want to go to where i &apos;m going to go and get my strength and <unk> . </s>
we are at the same time , with our <unk> of this device in this year . </s>
so it &apos;s true . </s>
let &apos;s look at our view of the numbers of the <unk> , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about . </s>
there are 68 million people who sit around the world in wheelchair . </s>
this is about one percent of the population . </s>
and that &apos;s what a conservative estimate . </s>
we talk about young people with the <unk> who live in the medical community -- &quot; oh , &quot; by fate , &quot; by fate , &quot; by fate , &quot; by fate , &quot; by fate . </s>
but it &apos;s also about the most expensive population , whose numbers are <unk> . </s>
and so pretty much the option -- if it &apos;s about a <unk> , or to another . </s>
and so , it has been since the way i have to say , is to say , very successful , i have to be very successful . </s>
so we thought we could start to write a whole new thing in the area . </s>
so let me now show you a <unk> that &apos;s been using amanda <unk> that has been unleashed a <unk> <unk> that they couldn &apos;t walk anymore for years , that they couldn &apos;t walk over 19 years and now . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
as i said , amanda , you know , &quot; <unk> . </s>
it has been sensors -- -- -- it &apos;s got . </s>
his <unk> sensors in the crutches that signals <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , who is here on their backs . </s>
here &apos;s also <unk> , who sits on the <unk> is to their hips , as on their <unk> , as on this very <unk> , very natural . </s>
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , when a <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
in a second , i lost each of every feeling every feeling of my feeling . </s>
not long after after a doctor , and he said , &quot; you can never get to go again . &quot; </s>
and this was 19 years ago . </s>
he <unk> every <unk> of my consciousness . </s>
and <unk> technologies have been taught to learn to be able to go back to and go to the hands of wheel . </s>
but nothing was invented me , until now , i would leave up until now . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
as you can see , we have the technology to express ourselves and with them , and then we discuss with them . </s>
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential to change life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for all the soldiers and all of them , but for everyone . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
at home in new york , i &apos;m a boss of a non-profit , named robin prime minister . </s>
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of fire . </s>
now , in our city , in the volunteers , in the volunteers , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> , you have to be quite early on the <unk> . </s>
i remember fire fire . </s>
i was the second volunteers of the <unk> , i had to get a good job in the <unk> . </s>
but it was still a <unk> against the other volunteer trying to reach the most tasks and what they would be the tasks . </s>
when i found the <unk> found , he &apos;s a very serious conversation with the <unk> who certainly had a worst deal with her life . </s>
it was in night and she was in <unk> and <unk> under a hot umbrella in the <unk> rain as her house in 1991 . </s>
the other one that was me on , was to me -- call him <unk> -- call him <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> as first and being asked to save the dog of the <unk> . </s>
i was blown away before . </s>
and there was a lawyer , or <unk> , who &apos;s now for the rest of his life , the people could tell us that he was a <unk> house , just because he was five seconds , just because he five seconds . </s>
well , i was the next . </s>
the <unk> <unk> me . </s>
he said , &quot; aw , you have to go into the house . </s>
they need to go up to the fire , and you &apos;ve got to get this woman , and you &apos;ve got to get this woman . &quot; </s>
i swear it . </s>
now , not exactly what i was in , but i went to los angeles -- the <unk> , the hallway , the hallway , the hallway , the <unk> , that had been done with the <unk> , in the bedroom , so the bedroom was going to take a pair . </s>
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero . </s>
i was my prey back to the bottom where i think about the front door , and the loved dog night . </s>
we put the treasures of out on the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , he &apos;s not surprising to the attention than mine . </s>
a few weeks later , the <unk> <unk> was a letter of the <unk> , where they &apos;re using the <unk> <unk> for their house . </s>
a more honest about anything , somebody had to have a few shoes of shoes . </s>
in robin <unk> , as a volunteer , as well as a volunteer , i &apos;m going to be a fireman of generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the lessons and the <unk> of the paper . </s>
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ? </s>
they &apos;re all important . </s>
so , if i &apos;m in this room and people see me that either have a <unk> success success , or on their way , i want to get serious messages to you , waiting for a reminder . </s>
wait for you to do a difference in your life , until she reached her first million . </s>
so if you have something , it &apos;s now about it . </s>
in a <unk> , put a park in the neighborhood , in a neighborhood , in a neighborhood , in a neighborhood . </s>
and they are a mentor . </s>
not all day to us a chance to save a human being , but every day , he offers us the opportunity to change . </s>
so you go to the shoes . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
bruno <unk> : mark , mark back . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
i &apos;m just going to return from a community back to the secret of human history . </s>
a place where women lead to the women &apos; s &apos; &quot; sex &apos; time , and the game had to be a serious issue . </s>
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> you or san francisco . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , your <unk> . </s>
this is the world &apos;s largest bonobo in the middle of congo . </s>
bonobos are working together with chimpanzees living with chimpanzees . </s>
that means we have a common ancestry , a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago . </s>
now , the chimps are known for their <unk> . </s>
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the aspect of human evolution in human evolution . </s>
but show us the other side of the site of the neighborhood . </s>
while chimps &apos;s chimps , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> . </s>
the fact that they really have a really <unk> in society because it leads to a real <unk> society in the population . </s>
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under primates . </s>
they live in the depths of the <unk> , and they &apos;re often a lot of damage to the disease . </s>
congo is a paradox -- a paradoxical -- a country of biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the revenue of a violent and almost so many lives have been so many lives like the first world war i. </s>
it doesn &apos;t surprised that the survival of bonobos are also survival of bonobos . </s>
and <unk> and the decline of the <unk> , that you don &apos;t even have a <unk> with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there are not safe to be honest . </s>
and yet , in this country , you can hear a <unk> <unk> that the trees can be inserted . </s>
who are these related ? </s>
we know it as &quot; love with a &quot; love war , &quot; because they have <unk> , also <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules and <unk> and social <unk> . </s>
i don &apos;t say , that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life is more than <unk> . </s>
bonobos like humans -- love , her life was playing her life . </s>
play doesn &apos;t just <unk> . </s>
for us , and it &apos;s game for us to get the bond of relations and the care of tolerance . </s>
we learn trust and the rules of the game . </s>
play is the <unk> and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the accumulation of diversity of diversity -- biodiversity , diversity of diversity , diversity of connections . </s>
and if you look at the game with the game , you can see the <unk> origins of human error , dance and ritual . </s>
game is the <unk> coefficient that we &apos;re <unk> . </s>
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique shots of the wild . </s>
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> . </s>
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> . </s>
look at what they do . </s>
this could be the evolutionary origin of the &quot; <unk> it . &quot; </s>
only i think it &apos;s more likely to be true . </s>
yes ! </s>
so , <unk> are also , both of bonobos as well as people . </s>
and this is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> , which is the <unk> that are the testes -- and also , how the game both can -- and also , as it does simultaneously . </s>
but the game is a <unk> . </s>
and a <unk> , and it can be many forms that are some shapes of which some of these are <unk> , and maybe the other thing -- may be again . </s>
and i want to show you , that &apos;s a calf , a calf female , and she plays the water . </s>
i think , just as you can do , as you can do , and we <unk> limitations and we &apos;re <unk> limitations of our interior and then we worlds worlds . </s>
and it &apos;s the same kind of curiosity that makes us tick , and we interact , and the unexpected wiring are the real <unk> of creativity . </s>
this is just a little <unk> to the insights that bonobos us in our past and present . </s>
but also , it &apos;s true a secret to our future , a future , where we &apos;re interested in the challenges , through larger creativity and <unk> . </s>
the secret is that the game is key to this . </s>
in other words , our <unk> . </s>
to be successful , we need to play , we need to play . </s>
but we &apos;re going to make the best thing we do ? </s>
play is not a silly thing . </s>
it &apos;s essential . </s>
for bonobos and people are equally not made of teeth and claws . </s>
just as it seems to be able to play it , maybe the <unk> . </s>
and so my favorite <unk> , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and collectively , as we play the creativity and the <unk> <unk> . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want you to imagine that two couples , at the same time , at the same time , the same day , at the same time , each <unk> is a baby -- okay . </s>
so two pairs of each <unk> is a baby . </s>
now i don &apos;t want to take a time that you &apos;re having the <unk> of your <unk> because if you think of the most time , they won &apos;t listen to me . </s>
now , you know , it &apos;s just a moment . </s>
and in this scenario scenario , you know , that &apos;s a case of a y <unk> <unk> that x chromosome at the x chromosome . </s>
and in the other case , it &apos;s a x chromosome that &apos;s the x chromosome , which is the x chromosome . </s>
both are <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ll come back to these people . </s>
and most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two things in my mind . </s>
under a hat , i &apos;m going to be with the history of anatomy . </s>
i &apos;m in the middle of the world , and in this case , i study how people were living with anatomy -- the human body , what they &apos;ve been thinking about body , with <unk> ; how they were thinking about body . </s>
the other hat i witnessed in my work is the <unk> , as a <unk> -- or how i say , as impatients as impatients -- from people who are patients from doctors to patients . </s>
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have <unk> social norms , the social norms of the community . </s>
so i &apos;ve worked with people who worked <unk> twins , two people in one bodies . </s>
i &apos;ve worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were little more than the typical . </s>
and very often , very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender <unk> is -- so people who are not the average male or female <unk> . </s>
and the general term can be done to use the word . </s>
in many different forms of forms . </s>
i &apos;ll give you just a couple of examples of the potential types of <unk> that are not male male , or female standard . </s>
in a case , you may have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y system , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of all . </s>
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re doing things in the <unk> cortex . </s>
but because this is the receptors of the receptors to recognize the testosterone , not the body of the body . </s>
and that &apos;s called <unk> . </s>
so much testosterone , but no response to a response . </s>
as a consequence , the body has increased more of the typical female spring . </s>
if the child is born , it looks like a girl . </s>
she &apos;s a girl . it &apos;s a girl . </s>
but it takes to puberty until they reached puberty , and their breasts are growing and developing countries , but not their period , until somebody &apos;s something else . </s>
and they make a couple of tests and find out that they were instead of <unk> and uterus , in fact , in fact , in fact , and they have a y chromosome . </s>
it &apos;s important to understand that person could be , but they &apos;re not really , really . </s>
women , like men , have something that you call a <unk> calls . </s>
it &apos;s in the back of our body . </s>
and the <unk> <unk> are hormones , which are hormones . </s>
most women , as i -- i think a typical woman would not be -- i think i &apos;m probably not my real <unk> , but most of the women i &apos;ve probably been to talk about . </s>
we produce <unk> and we talk to the <unk> . </s>
the consequence is that somebody like me , that more <unk> <unk> , than a woman who was born with testes , and a <unk> has been born . </s>
so , gender is really complicated ; don &apos;t even just change the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , you can be distributed about all the bandwidth , that &apos;s the whole range of gender . </s>
another example : a few years ago i had the call of a whole 19 of a 19 man who was born , as young as young , he had a girlfriend , had been his father , and he had just discovered that he had <unk> and a half a prisoner . </s>
he had a <unk> shape . </s>
he has <unk> , and in utero , his <unk> , so strong that they have a male source of a male signal . </s>
and as a consequence , his brain was male , his brain was the most <unk> male part of the <unk> . </s>
and when he was born , he looked like a young <unk> , no <unk> . </s>
and only when he was 19 years old , he got a medical student problems , he got to the medical records , because he was coming out of the inside of the inside of the inside . </s>
okay , just a quick example of <unk> , <unk> . </s>
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk> . </s>
we don &apos;t know why it &apos;s happening . </s>
so , the city can occur in many different varieties . </s>
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- by <unk> -- by <unk> -- by the <unk> , not because they &apos;re in physical health . </s>
in many cases , this is totally healthy . </s>
the reason why they often get different jobs , is because they threaten our social categories . </s>
typically , the system on the idea that a certain <unk> is a certain <unk> with a particular identity . </s>
so we have the concept that a woman has to have a female identity to be a black identity ; it means a african anatomy , a african african anatomy . </s>
so we &apos;ve got this horrible <unk> idea . </s>
and when we &apos;re dealing with a body who actually do something very different , because , in terms of that <unk> , confused for this <unk> . </s>
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> . </s>
and our nation really is a very romantic concept of <unk> . </s>
now , as well as it is , how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in one bodies , in one way , they &apos;re two persons in one body . </s>
where i was in the age of most of the year of the year was the <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender <unk> last year was in the <unk> <unk> in question . </s>
many journalists were called me , &quot; what are the test going to be , &quot; what will you do , &quot; what are you going to do is whether or male &apos;s male ? &quot; </s>
and i had to explain the journalists that it &apos;s not a test . </s>
we know now that gender is the very complicated thing that we have to admit that nature is that nature is not showing us a line between male and female ; <unk> are the content of the natural world . </s>
so , we have a situation where , ever , as we ever do our science , we need to be able to find the more complex that we have to stable , that these categories that that <unk> <unk> , much more serious than we have . </s>
and that &apos;s not just the gender . </s>
it also applies to even more than our more than our more complicated than our own <unk> . </s>
in our faith , we do have areas of all kinds of parts . </s>
we &apos;re finding for instance , we have been able to 95 percent of our dna with the chimpanzee . </s>
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re using a few of them are merely using some of you ? </s>
while we continue our science over , we come into a zone of the <unk> where we recognize that the <unk> categories that the <unk> categories that we were probably not allowed to be <unk> . </s>
we see this in all sorts of realms of human life . </s>
one of the areas where we see the <unk> in our culture , in the world today , in the united states today , the <unk> of the life and the end of life . </s>
we &apos;ve talked about this , which is what we can do , a body of the people that he is right now , and he &apos;s a life expectancy . </s>
we &apos;ve got a very tough ecosystem -- perhaps not as a little bit of the way -- about the question , when anyone is dead . </s>
our ancestors had never had so heavy that was dead . </s>
they have a <unk> feather under the nose , and if you go back , they don &apos;t have been buried . </s>
if you don &apos;t get a shower , you &apos;ve been buried . </s>
but today , we &apos;re now going to happen to a situation where we humans are <unk> organs and they want to be <unk> . </s>
and as we were in the fight with the really difficult question , when it &apos;s dead , and that &apos;s what does it really taught us to be more simple , we don &apos;t have the more simple categories of how the one we don &apos;t have . </s>
now , they could accept that the whole thing of categories was really happy to make me happy . </s>
i &apos;m political <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with some of the unusual bodies , but i have to say it . </s>
to realize that this category really is much more accurate than we thought , &quot; well , it &apos;s actually <unk> me . </s>
and it makes me a lot of it in terms of solar democracy . </s>
so , to tell you about this <unk> to tell you that i have to share a great fan of the founding . </s>
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great . </s>
i think they were so <unk> and strong and radically so much , in what they did that i was going to be doing all the years to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s been completed . </s>
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the <unk> . </s>
the founding had taken from my perspective , and it &apos;s why it &apos;s therefore . </s>
and what she was doing was a <unk> concept , and it &apos;s been <unk> , it &apos;s a different and beautiful , and 200 years for us . </s>
as you remember all of you , we can get the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy rate is at the bottom of the bottom , and the monarchy rate . </s>
the popular man of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> . </s>
they had a concept of blue blood . </s>
they were the notion that people who power that political power to the son of power to the son of the grandfather and so on . </s>
the founding meadows this idea and that &apos;s through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all of the people are creating . </s>
they <unk> the field and decided that &apos;s the <unk> that we counted the <unk> , and that was very radical . </s>
now , they made this part of the because they were part of a <unk> system that &apos;s two things together in common . </s>
democracy has been a <unk> , but also has been increasing the science of the science . </s>
if you look at the history of the lens , it &apos;s clear that many of you are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world . </s>
they went away from explanations by <unk> , and meadows things like a form of <unk> concept , back to where the transmission are grounded in a very <unk> way of <unk> . </s>
she &apos;s going to go to a <unk> concept . </s>
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and god nature . </s>
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature . </s>
they talk about who to say , we are . </s>
and as part of it , they get us a concept of <unk> . </s>
and so they really do have the future of the future . </s>
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great . </s>
so what happened after that ? </s>
for instance , women who are <unk> the concept of the founding system that says that the concept is defined by the anatomical difference , which is that anatomical is defined by the anatomical difference , the right thing is that the right thing is , etc . that we don &apos;t have the <unk> to have a difference . </s>
and women <unk> the successful . </s>
next came to the successful , where we humans have people saw <unk> <unk> that was <unk> about this , &quot; bin laden ? &quot; </s>
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> , which says , &quot; i am a man . &quot; </s>
again , humans have been tested in anatomical ways that are focused on anatomical similarities , and it &apos;s successful . </s>
we see the same <unk> . </s>
of course , the problem is that we start to think of the similarities , we start to think of question , why we &apos;re certain certain <unk> . </s>
now , i want to see certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture . </s>
i want to take a fish , like a human being , in a human , like a human . </s>
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take off of anatomy . </s>
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to sex or to go to the sex or to go to the u.s. </s>
so there &apos;s some anatomic that make me sense to make sense , and we think , i think , i should keep going . </s>
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and they &apos;re really meaningful them . </s>
so , we come back to these two approaches the beginning of the talk . </s>
we &apos;ve got two creatures , both at the same time , at the same time , the same <unk> . </s>
let &apos;s imagine that one of you , and one of them , three months of <unk> was born , she &apos;s in one june one of the one june . </s>
on the other hand , is born to the <unk> , he &apos;s on the one march , he &apos;s at the one march , he &apos;s at the one march , he &apos;s in the one march of waiting for a march . </s>
only because of the fact that maria <unk> <unk> had been born out of the <unk> , they all have three months to be the right to vote to vote . </s>
don &apos;t have to wait for all of these people , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth . </s>
we find even more <unk> than what their rights are . </s>
because of course , because you &apos;re having to be teaching that he &apos;s male , although i don &apos;t say that he &apos;s male , he can be moved to the fact that he &apos;s going to be a <unk> , which is not worrying about . </s>
maria , can &apos;t be in all the states in all the states , the <unk> of all states has been really married in all the states . </s>
in any country , in any country , a woman can marry a woman , but maria can only be a woman &apos;s married . </s>
so we &apos;ve got these <unk> categories in many ways that are actually problematic and questionable . </s>
and for me , imagine the question : what are we going to do , because our science of progress in the world is that we have to admit that we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy , <unk> ? </s>
i don &apos;t want science to give science , but at the same time , it &apos;s sometimes about the science of science . </s>
so where do we go ? </s>
it seems like our culture , a kind of spiritual attitude , &quot; well , we must pull somewhere else , so we &apos;ll pull it . &quot; </s>
but a lot of people are moving in a very strange position . </s>
so , for instance , texas , texas , texas , that a man , a man , a man , that you have no fabulous chromosome . </s>
now in practice , people don &apos;t have their resources . </s>
but it &apos;s also very bizarre to tell you about the story that i &apos;m telling you about the <unk> . </s>
if we look at a perspective of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his dream , he &apos;s a dream i talk about . </s>
he says we shouldn &apos;t be able to say , &quot; your skin , &quot; after the skin , &quot; judge , and then finally , about anatomy . </s>
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot; </s>
but how do you do that in practice ? </s>
how do you have people to <unk> ? </s>
i want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m sure that we should be interested in terms of people who are doing a lot more people who probably think about more people who probably know more than some people i know . </s>
i want to suggest that i probably know some weird risks that are <unk> , and more than some terrible decisions , and more than some of their sexual relations that i know . </s>
so how do we envision the question of the character of the character ? </s>
it turns out that it &apos;s a very difficult thing . </s>
and part of me , what if the content is a personality of me , which is a personality of a personality that could be made in the future ? </s>
do we really want to go to this way ? </s>
i &apos;m not sure we go . </s>
what i know is that it really seems to be important , about the idea that the united states is to make themselves think about questions of democracy . </s>
in our puzzle , we have our worst things right now , and i think we would make our own thing in the future . </s>
we don &apos;t have the situation as it was the case of the case is where a man who thinks sexually is not to other people &apos;s going to be a <unk> , because he &apos;s ready to be <unk> by a life that he &apos;s alive . </s>
one way of us not . </s>
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have this research -- a surgeon with a few years ago , the <unk> twins , who had <unk> twins to separate her to separate a name to separate one name . </s>
but when i was playing with him , and he asked him , why he made this surgeries -- it was highly <unk> surgeries -- was his response to these children , these kids really become very bad , and therefore he had to do it . </s>
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political words in a few surgery , &quot; i &apos;m a operation in a operation . &quot; </s>
u.s. u.s. state provide an incredible opportunity to be the ones that they are without the state of space , without the state of space will change . </s>
so i think we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be . </s>
well , just to notice that i &apos;m realizing that i &apos;m very much about fathers . </s>
and i want to think about the possibilities of democracy , or looked at the mothers , if we had the mothers more involved . </s>
and i want to say something that is a feminist radical for a feminist and that &apos;s what i think there might be different insights that have been different from different kinds of anatomy , <unk> when humans have a <unk> . </s>
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in the area of the <unk> . </s>
and one of the things that i really found interesting is about men and women in ways of thinking about men and women in ways of how they think about and in the world . </s>
what we &apos;ve experienced from <unk> studies is that women , in the average -- not any but any time -- rather complex relationships and the most vulnerable , the ones who are the most vulnerable social relationships , very much attention to the group . </s>
and so if we think about it , we have a interesting situation . </s>
and when i was a graduate student , when i was a graduate student , i was a <unk> , my interest in feminism of feminism -- i looked at a bad , so that &apos;s a really relevant thing . </s>
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s wrong . &quot; </s>
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
in feminism , it &apos;s about gender , which is why nothing is about gender . </s>
but the more i think about his question : i thought there &apos;s something more <unk> in feminism to be able to give something more . </s>
it &apos;s called the <unk> , it could be something that &apos;s different from male events in the average of different disciplines of social spaces , and <unk> for the <unk> . </s>
so the founding founding can be protected by individuals , and the individuals who are protected by the state that we could be protected , not just how to be more mothers , not just how to relate to each other , but we can actually make for each other . </s>
and maybe it &apos;s where we &apos;ve done democracy in the future , when we democracy about anatomy anatomy -- less about the individual body -- less than identity and more about relationships . </s>
so that if we are a <unk> connection as we are trying to think about what we can do for each other . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase . </s>
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> . </s>
i love to invite you to a opportunity to find a different <unk> , <unk> , and to be careful , also to be able to go and learn to be ashamed . </s>
but i don &apos;t buy anything . </s>
i get all my clothes from the second hand , and in <unk> , <unk> . </s>
ooh . </s>
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment and also the landing . </s>
i meet all kinds of great people ; my daily purpose for 6,000 dollars ; i &apos;m pretty unique from ; i &apos;m pretty unique from ; i &apos;m pretty unique . </s>
i mean , find out of what i find today ? </s>
it &apos;s my height of the size ? </s>
i &apos;m going to be the color ? </s>
it &apos;s less than 20 dollars &apos; worth of 20 dollars ? </s>
and if all the answers yes , i &apos;m looking at myself as if i won . </s>
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i did for this exciting week here at ted . </s>
i mean , what brings up with so many of these <unk> with so many ? </s>
so i &apos;m going to show you a bit precisely what i did . </s>
i brought seven to the other , and that &apos;s all . </s>
games for exactly what i did in my suitcase and i &apos;ve done in my suitcase . </s>
i have been sending that i might wear anything , which i would answer , i would find , if i was going to be able to get to palm . </s>
and since they don &apos;t hear me as the woman who &apos;s here in ted , which is ted in ted underwear -- is that i found a couple of things . </s>
and i want to show you my <unk> for this week . </s>
sounds good ? </s>
while i &apos;m going to do that , i &apos;m also giving you some of the lessons that i &apos;m sure , whether you &apos;re learned to wear a new thing . </s>
let &apos;s start with sunday . </s>
i call this the prescription tigers . </s>
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of good things . </s>
you can almost always look more than 50 dollars . </s>
this is a very big , including the <unk> has been brought up to 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that i &apos;ve been doing in all week . </s>
monday is a little more powerful . </s>
it &apos;s almost impossible to be poor , bad <unk> , if you &apos;re pants . </s>
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to get other people &apos;s bigger . </s>
tuesday , it &apos;s totally <unk> . </s>
i spent a lot of time with my life , trying to be myself , and i simultaneously adapt to be myself . </s>
just be , who you are . </s>
if you &apos;re surrounded with the most innovative people , they won &apos;t just understand it , they &apos;ll be able to estimate it . </s>
wednesday : embrace your inner child . </s>
sometimes i &apos;m going to tell you guys , i &apos;m going to be a <unk> , i &apos;m going to be playing my own , i remember , i remember her . </s>
i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; thank you . &quot; </s>
thursday is the key . </s>
if you think you think about something , it &apos;s almost like this . </s>
and if you think of something that you &apos;re not doing well , you probably are right now . </s>
i grew up with a mother who taught me a day . </s>
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means . </s>
and i &apos;m going to sit down for you . </s>
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and you &apos;re a beautiful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear . </s>
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here . </s>
we should be able to do anything we want to do . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
friday <unk> : a universal truth of everything -- golden words : golden <unk> . </s>
and finally , saturday : a sense of personal , personal style is a great way to tell a little bit about a kind of a thing , without a word . </s>
it was always shown and again , when in this week , people were just to come out because of what i was wearing . and i had fantastic conversations . </s>
clearly , that &apos;s not all of my little suitcase . </s>
so , before i go home , i &apos;m going to have a lot of donations . </s>
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week to learn that it &apos;s okay to be . </s>
i don &apos;t have to take that stuff out of <unk> , because the road is still a crazy musician , <unk> , <unk> , a little love that just pushes up me when i &apos;m a little love in the heart of the heart and it &apos;s looking at it . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
thank you . </s>
good afternoon . </s>
i want to show you here . </s>
think of it as a <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s what we call our lab , <unk> design . </s>
let me tell you a little bit about it . </s>
if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally with italians in italy with this picture -- but the reason i &apos;m in italy with this picture is that the one in the formula , but the reason i &apos;m showing you showing you . </s>
a few days ago , when you get a formula , if you wanted to win a formula , you took your budget to your budget and put her money to a good driver . </s>
and if the car and drivers were good enough , they won &apos;t be <unk> . </s>
now , when you win a race , if you want to win a race , a little bit like this here , some thousand sensors in real time , some thousands of information sensors , the information from the car , and then it uses the <unk> to be <unk> back to the system and then things happen in real time . </s>
this would be in <unk> , a <unk> call . </s>
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made of two parts -- a <unk> portion of a piece of <unk> . </s>
what &apos;s interesting is , is the <unk> worldview in our lives . </s>
our cities were being locked in the past few years , just with bugs and electronics . </s>
they &apos;ll be able to become a computer in free . </s>
and as a computer , starting to be able to react to other kinds of ways they &apos;re perceived and driven . </s>
when we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal . </s>
but only by the way i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the land , but 50 percent of the world population live there . </s>
they &apos;re 75 percent of the oil -- but more than 80 percent of co2 emissions . </s>
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal . </s>
over the cities , we put all this <unk> and fix in objects of everyday life . </s>
this is from a exhibition , the paola antonelli industry in moma after moma , in the year of it . </s>
it &apos;s called &quot; i &apos;m going to give me . &quot; </s>
now , all of our objects , we &apos;re starting to speak to us . </s>
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as an atom to each atom is out there to be outside , a sensor and a <unk> . </s>
and the changes of the interaction is that we humans have the environment in our environment . </s>
it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of the old dream of the world ... </s>
you know , when a <unk> pulled up the moses , it &apos;s that he &apos;s at the end hammer , and it &apos;s looking at moses -- actually , &quot; <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you recommend a little <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you recommend ? &quot; </s>
now , the first time , our environment is first starting to answer us . </s>
i &apos;m going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and gigantic . </s>
let &apos;s start with the front . </s>
now the first project i &apos;d like to introduce you to you about is in one of our first person . </s>
it was in italy , in italy . </s>
and what we did was , was a more novel kind of network of network that all the world was used on all the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and we &apos;re using information from the network to understand how the city works . </s>
the summer was a happier -- 2006 . </s>
it was a italy group of the <unk> . </s>
some of you may remember , it was a italy in france , and then at the end , the end of the <unk> . </s>
the end of the end , the end of the end , &quot; italy . </s>
now look at what happened at this day , just watch the activity of the activity in the network . </s>
here &apos;s the city . </s>
you can see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . </s>
in the morning , the game . </s>
they &apos;re looking at the time . </s>
early on the other hand , people here and there are the <unk> and moving . </s>
the game begins -- silence . </s>
france . italy , a gate . </s>
<unk> , people making a little call , go on a toilet . </s>
second of the normal is the normal school . </s>
first , second . </s>
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> . </s>
torture . yeah . yeah . </s>
now , in this night , he was going to celebrate the center . </s>
they saw the big rash . </s>
next day , all the time to meet the <unk> and the prime minister of time . </s>
and then everyone was walking down . </s>
you see the image of the field of the space <unk> <unk> , where people were having to have a big party , and you &apos;ll see a big party , and you can see the rash at the end of the day . </s>
now , this is just a example of how we can feel about the city of the city , and we could feel like a few years ago . </s>
another example of the example of this is not about people , but we &apos;re not about things that we use and consume things that we use and consume . </s>
well , we know all our things about it . </s>
this is a map that you &apos;re looking at all the chips that makes you a mac computer , like a mac computer , how they came together . </s>
but we know very little about where things go . </s>
so we actually designed some small markers designed to pursue the trash as he &apos;s going through the system . </s>
so we started with some volunteers starting to tag in front of the things that we have to find out about a year , which is to tag the things they were -- different ways of things like you can see -- things that they would all throw out . </s>
then we have the little chips that little brands , on the trash and started to pursue it . </s>
so here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve just got . </s>
of seattle ... </s>
after one week . </s>
with this information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system . </s>
we can do the same things in doing that energy . </s>
the data were not available . </s>
but that &apos;s going to happen a lot of <unk> and more complex things . </s>
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , the cup that we throw , not just the one somewhere on the planet , that they still have somewhere on the planet . </s>
and the plastic that we &apos;re still going to go on . </s>
and if we show that people , we can get a behavior . </s>
so that &apos;s the reason for this project . </s>
my colleague of working with , <unk> <unk> , could you still give them more about the experience and the many other wonderful things that you can do with you , but i want to talk to the second part of our environment that we &apos;re at the beginning and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment . </s>
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain . </s>
it started with a question of the <unk> who came to us and said that spain and <unk> a nice tradition of a beautiful tradition of water . </s>
and the question was , how could you create technology , new technology ? </s>
and one of the ideas that was in a <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> these tubes , and the valves , the <unk> , valves , valves and closing . </s>
they &apos;re actually like a <unk> with water . </s>
if you can get this <unk> , you can write them patterns , images , you can see patterns . </s>
and you can go to him , and he &apos;s open up to open up to this picture , as you can see on this picture . </s>
now , we &apos;ve got the mayor of <unk> . </s>
it has to be very . </s>
and we got the mission to design a building in the <unk> . </s>
we called it the digital water <unk> . </s>
the whole building was made of water . </s>
there are no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re going to go to it , it &apos;s open and it &apos;s going to open up . </s>
the roof was also covered with water . </s>
and when it &apos;s windy , if you want to take it down , you can even make the roof . </s>
or you could conclude the building and the whole architecture of architecture , like in this case , you know , that days when you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and they say , &quot; they have the building . &quot; </s>
no , they don &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappear . </s>
you see here , how do we work . </s>
you see the person who is what happens in the inside . </s>
and here you see me when i was trying to check the test of the sensors , not wet to become a <unk> . </s>
now , i should tell you what a night was going to work as a farmer . </s>
but actually , it was fun to do more than that . </s>
all the kids have children come from <unk> , because the way they were playing with the building . </s>
no longer a building that would be open to you , but a building that &apos;s still breaks and holes in the water , you had to get to jump up without getting wet . </s>
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers always , we always think about how people we think about how people we have . </s>
but the reality is always unpredictable . </s>
and that &apos;s the beauty of the things that are used to be used and with people . </s>
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections on it . </s>
and this is what we think about the following and the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now . </s>
now , you can fly these <unk> to fly . </s>
imagine if you could have little helicopter that go through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud of light , a cloud like the space can move through the space . </s>
here &apos;s the video . </s>
imagine a helicopter , as you saw earlier , the way you saw with others , totally adapted with others . </s>
you can have this cloud . </s>
you can see a kind of <unk> screen , or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions . </s>
or , but also in three dimensions , where changes what changes the light is not the position of the <unk> . </s>
you can play with different kinds of things . </s>
imagine if you could easily be a <unk> in different heights or <unk> , in different ways . </s>
but then the whole thing is just a 3d cloud of <unk> , which they can take and through the structure that you can see from many , many directions . </s>
here &apos;s a real <unk> that <unk> <unk> to form a <unk> v . </s>
so , if you turn the lights , it looks like this , so just as we saw it before . </s>
imagine that every single one of people will be more . </s>
it could be a impulse that could have impulse in human <unk> , from people who are the movements of humans . </s>
let me show you a little too . </s>
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> in the mid- theater and the <unk> theater in milan theater and the <unk> in milan -- we have 3d movements in 3d <unk> . </s>
here &apos;s what you see here . </s>
on the left side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations . </s>
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> . </s>
so that &apos;s how you can make the whole movement . </s>
they can do that . </s>
but then , if we have all <unk> , you can play with the <unk> and <unk> playing with color movement and <unk> . </s>
we want to use a potential impulse to the <unk> . </s>
i want to show you the latest project about it . </s>
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working for the olympics for the olympics . </s>
it &apos;s called the cloud . </s>
and the idea is again , imagine that we take that to do something that we take people to do something like you and the environment -- almost as a little bit of how you move a <unk> , but with a cloud . </s>
imagine that every single one can offer you for a <unk> . </s>
i think the fact that the remarkable is the last bit of the last decades , we &apos;re going to be able to have a digital world of a physical world . </s>
it &apos;s all the way , knowledge and makes it through the internet . </s>
today , we can see the first time -- and the campaign , the campaign showed that -- we can see from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of networks . </s>
that can be in our case that we use it to design and a symbol . </s>
the one thing is , in the city . </s>
but tomorrow , to take challenges , to ensure the challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we change the digital world in the physical world . </s>
so the idea is that we actually actually do the people with it , in the things they &apos;re doing together . </s>

and these haze are water , as our cloud cloud is a cloud of <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s a pretty light in london , but with <unk> covers . </s>
they can move inside and different kinds of experiences . </s>
you can actually see it from the bottom of the bottom , the most important moments of <unk> 2012 and the other parts , and it &apos;s a way of connecting to the community . </s>
so both of the physical cloud , and something that would enable you to go through the <unk> and <unk> . </s>
you can see , in the end . </s>
and a way of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone who want to go to the top . </s>
thank you . </s>
as artists is very important . </s>
by my work , i &apos;m trying to express people &apos;s people who are separated from nature and that all connected to each other is . </s>
the first time i was a little bit about 10 years ago in the antarctic , where i saw my first <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m awe awe . </s>
my heart was <unk> , i was trying to grab myself to what was going on . </s>
the calving had been around me , <unk> <unk> , and i could only decide that this was a leader on a different point of a snowflake , year year . </s>
as a calf , born a <unk> or <unk> of <unk> out of <unk> . </s>
everybody has its own individual personality . </s>
they &apos;re very much in the environment and their experiences . </s>
some of the people feel and <unk> until the bitter <unk> , while others not withstand more withstand and in a <unk> state passion . </s>
if you look at a iceberg you think you &apos;re easily isolated , separately , separately and alone , just as we can see people who are often seen us . </s>
but the truth is far away . </s>
while a <unk> <unk> , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere . </s>
during the ice season , he puts <unk> drinking water , which many of the forms of life . </s>
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of these ages as i was portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness that they have been tested in this individual moments of these , and never be so . </s>
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt , it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> of your brain is not a <unk> of your life . </s>
i &apos;m part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m very young -- some thousand years old . </s>
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old . </s>
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i &apos;ve been in <unk> in the <unk> . </s>
very rarely will be a <unk> <unk> . </s>
here &apos;s it . </s>
on the left hand , you see a little boat . </s>
this is about five feet long . </s>
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where he &apos;s going to be in the middle of the <unk> . </s>
you can see here he begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there . </s>
that &apos;s the average size of a <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s about 120 foot of water from the water , or 40 meters . </s>
and this video is real . </s>
and just as you , show you the one side of the personality of his personality . </s>
thank you . </s>
my life is really quite a few of the work of some amazing projects . </s>
but at the coolest , i &apos;ve ever worked it , he went to this guy . </s>
his name is <unk> . </s>
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1960s . </s>
then one day , he came back from walking and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot; </s>
and that was the essence of the world . </s>
<unk> is completely <unk> . </s>
he can use his eyes . </s>
i was able to tell him . </s>
i have a company that design and animations , so we &apos;re inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the economic and the <unk> and the <unk> . </s>
we decided , tony -- <unk> -- <unk> -- and his own thing . </s>
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money , we &apos;ll give you this money . </s>
what do you do with this ? &quot; </s>
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony . </s>
i want to do it with him and i said , &quot; wait , not a minute , i saw stephen hawking -- not all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard a remarkable ball and a remarkable insurance , you can actually do that . </s>
ordinary people are not available to us . &quot; </s>
and i said , &quot; how do you get ? &quot; </s>
somebody has been the movie &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot; </s>
so you can walk away -- your finger to go . </s>
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can be that ? &quot; </s>
so i came to the desire , just a check a check , and instead i got a check out of that , i &apos;m not going to <unk> him , how i was going to <unk> him . </s>
i drew a place and he &apos;s looking at place and he &apos;s looking at his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , tony &apos;s -- tony &apos;s &quot; a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to find a way to do his art . </s>
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who can &apos;t communicate , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot; </s>
so i spoke a few months later . </s>
i met these people from <unk> , and they have a technology that allows them to come to a light surface on every single surface and then with a <unk> approach that &apos;s just the negative area . </s>
so they pull around and make the <unk> like this . </s>
they say that all the things that are there , a life of follow . </s>
it begins with the testes , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the u.k. </s>
but there was always a life in their presentations . </s>
so i went home and ate my wife and told her , and we thought , &quot; well , if you have this technology that can use your eyes to control the things that you can use to control using the <unk> to control things , so that he can make your mind again to control things . &quot; </s>
that was the beginning of the journey . </s>
and about two years later , about a year later , after a year later , and a lot of things we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve reached some things , we &apos;ve accomplished some things . </s>
first of all , we have the insurance doors <unk> , and actually have a device that actually can get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> . </s>
that was amazing . </s>
and it &apos;s really quite funny -- i call him <unk> , because you &apos;re talking about it , or gets a email , and you &apos;re so , &quot; i am so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot; </s>
and we have seven million all of the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- literally , we were looking at home . </s>
my wife , my kids and i &apos;ve invaded in garage , and these hacker have our house , and we have our house and <unk> . </s>
so many of our friends , we thought we &apos;re beautiful dumb to do that , and all the images of that we &apos;re all <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been using our weeks , we went to <unk> in the <unk> zoo , my kids , and we created this . </s>
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description . </s>
this is a cheap policy that we &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> of <unk> , some of the things that &apos;s been doing some things and some things from the garden and <unk> . </s>
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they have a <unk> of the field of <unk> , and now we have a device that we build a device in the code for free , which is the software , the software . </s>
so we created a device that &apos;s completely devoid of limitations of limitations . </s>
no insurance can be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
no hospital . </s>
every <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes with his eyes . </s>
thank you . </s>
thanks to be incredible . </s>
at the end of two weeks , we went back to <unk> <unk> . </s>
i love this picture because it &apos;s room by someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his bedroom . </s>
now , there &apos;s all this <unk> <unk> of the big revelation of the great unveiling of the great unveiling of the great unveiling of the great unveiling . </s>
and after about a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , brazil , first of all , the first time , for seven years . </s>
and this is a amazing picture , because this is his life , and he &apos;s seeing his life . </s>
we have his bed , he can see it out . </s>
we &apos;ve got a video clip against the hospital . </s>
and he drew over and he &apos;s a first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense of feeling was . </s>
we had to also have to have the parking lot in the parking lot , we felt a bit of a part of the <unk> . </s>
and at the end of the end , he was doing a <unk> with a <unk> , for the first time , i drew something . </s>
i have been the feeling i was under water and finally , and finally , and my head is a <unk> , so i can breathe with that . &quot; </s>
isn &apos;t that ? </s>
that &apos;s what our <unk> <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re developing the <unk> and we &apos;re developing on it . </s>
and we need to improve this device . </s>
it &apos;s a remarkable device , but it comes a <unk> . </s>
and somebody who has a potential <unk> potential , which has so much more . </s>
so we &apos;re doing , how do you better understand it better , faster and stronger power . </s>
since this time we get all kinds of recognition . </s>
we won a couple of prizes . </s>
remember , it &apos;s free to us , no one of us . </s>
it &apos;s all about our own pockets . </s>
so the food was fantastic , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot; </s>
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , we have the <unk> honored as one of the 50 of 50 , in his 20s , in a class 2010 , which was really great . </s>
the <unk> part of it is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that it april this april , <unk> <unk> in the inner-city of los angeles , called &quot; the &quot; kind of <unk> &quot; in the city of the <unk> . &quot; </s>
and there are so much the toughest dragline of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- all these boys are being broken . </s>
<unk> is part of the show , which is quite quite a nice . </s>
basically , basically , if you look at something , that &apos;s impossible , that &apos;s impossible , then you can get it . </s>
all right in this room was impossible -- this one , this computer , this computer , this computer , this computer , the <unk> -- everything was impossible . </s>
do you all here . it &apos;s a lot of them . </s>
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had something to do with <unk> , but i just got some work and i &apos;m just talking about amazing people , so we could make something on the legs . </s>
and this question is , every single one of you want to show you something that is going to be done , if not now , when not , when not i do , and if i don &apos;t , who &apos;s not going to be done ? </s>
thank you . </s>
so i write about kids for children , and probably america <unk> <unk> . </s>
and i always say that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist that i &apos;m not going to come . </s>
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever been sequenced . </s>
today i want to tell you about the senses and i tell you . </s>
well , a <unk> is a <unk> for everybody , you find it all the time . </s>
you go to the block and take it as a revelation . </s>
this is a painting of a circle . </s>
richard of my friends , it made -- richard <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of what i want to tell you today . </s>
my circle started in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , ohio in <unk> , where i was the <unk> . </s>
i was a little , the one week in the <unk> and blue <unk> was beaten up to a teacher . </s>
she saved my life , by me , by the toilet to use . </s>
they did that , they did it . </s>
and it did for three years , she did it for three years . </s>
and i had to go out from the city . </s>
i had a thumb , i had my <unk> , and it was lifted me to california in california in california -- i found a <unk> -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it in a way of <unk> . </s>
about three or four years ago , i received in a call from this teacher , woman who said , &quot; i have to see them . </s>
i &apos;m sad , we never learned as adults , as adults . </s>
and i want to come to check you , and i come together with the man that i know you &apos;ve found him . </s>
and i should say , and i should want you to get a <unk> , and i want you to get it . &quot; </s>
well , the day we were in cleveland . </s>
we saw them , we laughed , we &apos;re seeing , and we knew that they &apos;d be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
we found one of them for them , we brought them to the <unk> , and we put it on her family eight , because it was necessary to the fact that it was necessary to me . </s>
it was something we were doing . </s>
and just as adults , the woman wanted to learn when adults was learning , they turned me into a box full of my box and became in my hands . </s>
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of the revelation that i talked about . </s>
the revelation of life is . </s>
she &apos;s my life rescued , and my partner and i &apos;m tuned down . </s>
and you know , this part of life needs anything that needs the rest of life . </s>
he needs to be truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so many times . </s>
he takes the same way -- he would need love , love and delight . and it &apos;s about us to give these things . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
imagine a big blast in the 1,000 , as they go on 1,000 feet . </s>
now , you know , you &apos;ll notice a plane . </s>
now imagine a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
sounds fear . </s>
now , i had a unique space that day i was sitting on <unk> . </s>
i was the only one who could speak with the <unk> . </s>
so i looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem , we have a few birds , we have a few birds . &quot; </s>
the pilot had the machine already , and we were not so far away . </s>
you could see manhattan , you could see manhattan . </s>
two minutes later , three things at the same time . </s>
the pilot came from the machine river . </s>
that &apos;s not the route . </s>
he <unk> the sound . </s>
imagine a <unk> airplane . </s>
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words that i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
the south of the day he says , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the <unk> . </s>
i could see it in their eyes , there was no life . </s>
i want to share three things that i learned about me . </s>
i learned that in a moment , is a different from a moment . </s>
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought about all the people i wanted to <unk> , and it didn &apos;t make a hand , and it didn &apos;t make the fences that i wanted to make . </s>
while i later , i noticed that a phrase , the &quot; i &apos;m bad , &quot; i &apos;m bad . </s>
because when the wine is , when the wine person is there , i &apos;m seeing him . </s>
i never want to live in life . </s>
and this is really changed . </s>
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we washington , we were looking at george smoot -- i thought , there &apos;s one thing i thought , there &apos;s one thing i really do . </s>
i had life . </s>
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to be better in everything i was going to be better . </s>
but in my humanity , i gave my ego to my ego . </s>
and i &apos;m <unk> the time i wasted for <unk> things , with people who mean something . </s>
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people . </s>
and after that , i decided to be decided to be negative energy from my life . </s>
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better . </s>
i didn &apos;t have two years to speak . </s>
it feels great . </s>
i &apos;m not trying to have right now ; i &apos;m making myself . </s>
the third thing i learned -- and he &apos;s looking at the internal clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; the <unk> , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; </s>
you can see water . </s>
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot; </s>
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts of the same parts of how you &apos;re going to see it . </s>
while we were having this feeling , human , to die is not a cheap . </s>
almost like we prepare for our lives . </s>
but it was very sad . </s>
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life . </s>
and this is really what we really had to be in a mind , which is that i &apos;m just seeing one thing . </s>
i just wished to see my children , i could see my children . </s>
a month after a month , i was a leader -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ... </s>
... not yet . </s>
and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;m a little kid like a little kid . </s>
and in the world , everything is a sense of me . </s>
i realized , by telling the dots , that it &apos;s just about the dots that it &apos;s just about to be a great father . </s>
more than anything , is my greatest purpose in life , a good father . </s>
i was not able to die at that day . </s>
i was a more present gift to see , which is to see the future and the other way . </s>
and my call to all that fly is to fly today , imagine , imagine , the same thing happens on their flight -- please — — but imagine it yourself . </s>
what would you do that they &apos;re wearing the same thing because they think they were there for always ? </s>
how would you change your relationship and the negative energy in it is to be the negative energy ? </s>
and more than anything , they are the best parents that are just being able to be ? </s>
thank you . </s>
the idea behind the <unk> is really a <unk> . </s>
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb . </s>
the most important thing there is the <unk> in the development of nuclear power . </s>
the main boxes that you see here , these are <unk> . </s>
now , if we &apos;re working with the systems that are able to treat systems and valves and valves , and then we can actually make a lot of problems with the centrifuge . </s>
these gray boxes run not with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology . </s>
but if we do it , that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in a laptop that &apos;s used to be a laptop box that &apos;s used to be <unk> , then we are in store . </s>
and that &apos;s planning behind it . </s>
so we start with a <unk> . </s>
the <unk> will be in the gray box , the <unk> and iranian iranian system , they &apos;re <unk> . </s>
this is a log , right ? </s>
i want to tell you how we found . </s>
when we started to <unk> our research , six months ago , what was the purpose of the sense of purpose and purpose . </s>
the only thing we knew is very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
and it seemed something to <unk> these numbers boxes , that <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
the <unk> our attention , we started a <unk> project where we &apos;re our environment in <unk> , and we looked at the <unk> . </s>
and then something weird happened . </s>
<unk> <unk> , like a <unk> that doesn &apos;t like a <unk> that we don &apos;t like food , but didn &apos;t eat it . </s>
this is in my eyes . </s>
and after we had various kinds of cheese species , i went to that this is a <unk> attack . </s>
so , completely a particular goal . </s>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the face , when a particular thing was discovered , even if the one thing program is to get at it on this goal . </s>
and if not , <unk> , nothing . </s>
so , the most part , and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is . </s>
it could be , say , an <unk> american <unk> , or a <unk> in germany . </s>
so let &apos;s really figure out what the goal is . </s>
so we <unk> and <unk> , we found that he &apos;s two digital warheads of <unk> -- a smaller and a larger . </s>
and we also noticed that they were very professional constructed , from people who obviously all venezuelan information information to have information . </s>
they knew bits and <unk> that they had to attack . </s>
probably even known as the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
so they knew everything . </s>
and if you have been already , that the <unk> of <unk> complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for . </s>
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen . </s>
here &apos;s a clip of the <unk> code . </s>
we talk about 15,000 lines . </s>
looks pretty much like the <unk> . </s>
and i want to get to tell you how we &apos;re going to become smart . </s>
so what we were looking at as first of being <unk> , because we know what this can do . </s>
and then we stopped looking for <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring this together into the real world -- with potential goals in the real world . </s>
so we needed to think about these goals we could or learn the word or the service . </s>
and in order to make this theories , we call it in reminder that it &apos;s definitely around <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and very likely , it &apos;s in iran because most infections . </s>
well , in this territory , there is not a thousand people . </s>
basically , it &apos;s basically the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> . </s>
so i said to my assistant , &quot; the &quot; minister of all me are experts for <unk> and <unk> from our <unk> . &quot; </s>
and i called them to come up with you and you know , you know , you know , what we had in code and in the data and in the data . </s>
and that worked really good . </s>
so , it was possible to bring the small digital <unk> with the <unk> fisheries . </s>
and the rotor is that the moving part of these black object , you know , that black object you can see . </s>
and if you take the speed of this <unk> , you actually , you actually have the rotor <unk> and the eventually , the lead to explode . </s>
what we &apos;ve discovered is that the goal of the attack was actually slow and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> -- obviously they don &apos;t get to get able to come to the next to the way that they would be able to go to the location . </s>
the big digital <unk> -- we got a window that we &apos;re very closely in a very short and <unk> . </s>
so for instance , <unk> <unk> is very , from this code ; you can &apos;t get it . </s>
i started to think of scientific literature , which is how these <unk> found out in <unk> , and found out that they are in <unk> , and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk> . </s>
so , that made it together . </s>
and it &apos;s better . </s>
these <unk> are in iran in 15 days in 15 . </s>
and guess what we found in the <unk> ? </s>
a almost identical structure . </s>
so again , the most good thing . </s>
and this was a big confidence for that we investigated here . </s>
now , don &apos;t just get me that , &quot; it wasn &apos;t easy . </s>
so these results have been achieved by many other people . </s>
and often we got a very <unk> and we had to start anew . </s>
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually more quickly in reality , but the same goal , but from different directions . </s>
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> and slowed down the board and slowed them and slowed them and <unk> them and <unk> . </s>
so , in the big , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have to have that , what the goal is . </s>
it &apos;s just <unk> . </s>
so we don &apos;t have to worry about that other goals of <unk> , could be made by <unk> . </s>
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- i &apos;ve discovered this -- really , really , really . </s>
there is the gray gray , gray , and on top of the top you see the <unk> . </s>
now , what this thing is that this thing is that it &apos;s the very peculiar value of sensors -- so for example , <unk> -- and it &apos;s about <unk> code who &apos;s been doing code during the age of the attack , with the wrong with the wrong with the time , with the one , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . </s>
and in fact , this false <unk> is already <unk> . </s>
so it &apos;s like the same way in <unk> , where during the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
this is cool ? </s>
and the idea is obviously not just that <unk> <unk> in the way . </s>
in fact , it &apos;s more dangerous and more interesting . </s>
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> . </s>
we need digital culture where a human doesn &apos;t respond to the way a human <unk> can &apos;t be overstated . </s>
so in a <unk> , for example , if the big <unk> is going to be going to be going to be going to be a <unk> within milliseconds . </s>
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> . </s>
so we need digital <unk> . </s>
and when they &apos;re growing up really bad things . </s>
the power can explode . </s>
and neither the <unk> is going to be a <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s scary . </s>
but it &apos;s even worse . </s>
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important . </s>
think about it . this is <unk> . this is <unk> . </s>
he has nothing specifically to do with <unk> acid with <unk> . </s>
so he would say , &quot; well , right now , in a <unk> , or in a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> . </s>
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- not to have the <unk> -- you have to relax a <unk> of a <unk> . </s>
you could also have a blind technology for the spread of the spread . </s>
you have to spread it as far as possible . </s>
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask ourselves . </s>
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals are not in the middle east . </s>
it &apos;s in europe and japan , and japan . </s>
so all of these green areas are the environments . </s>
we need to put the consequences and we &apos;re going to be able to push ourselves . </s>
thank you . </s>
i have a question . </s>
ralph , it was a lot of that people who think the average <unk> is the <unk> function of the <unk> . </s>
is also your mind opinion ? </s>
okay ? </s>
yes . okay . </s>
i think that &apos;s the <unk> dancer , but the driving force is not israel . </s>
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower . </s>
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , thankfully , thankfully . </s>
now , even more than bigger . </s>
thank you for a <unk> <unk> . thank you . </s>
i spent the last couple of years of studying myself in situations that normally are very difficult and the same dangerous . </s>
i went to prison . </s>
i worked in a <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ve been filmed in <unk> , difficult and dangerous . </s>
and i spent 30 days to eat nothing about this -- it was a little difficult in the middle , a little bit difficult in the middle . </s>
i actually got the most part of my career in the <unk> part of my own situations , and that &apos;s all the way to take care of social <unk> so that they are compelling and interesting to a sense of what they do for the audience . </s>
so when i knew i was here , i &apos;d come to come here to see the world from <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , i knew i &apos;d make something a little bit more . </s>
some of you may hear that i heard a little weeks ago , a single <unk> of ebay . </s>
i spent a couple of <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the chance to <unk> the <unk> of my tedtalk . </s>
really , some of these happy people and companies and companies and <unk> , the unique evidence , the unique anderson -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson had a lot of content and not many evidence for what was supposed to be the issue . </s>
so what you got was this : your name here is my tedtalk here : my tedtalk , from the way , and the subject you &apos;ve ever had to be , and you &apos;ve given the ears to fly for your participation . </s>
but it &apos;s also a very good way of doing it . </s>
do you know how many people have to look at this ? </s>
all of the things . </s>
this is just the <unk> . </s>
so , despite that warning , i knew that anybody would go to the fact that the <unk> would go . </s>
if you had this , i was asked to this , i didn &apos;t have to have a year to tell you . </s>
but in new project , i &apos;m working , my new film , we study the world &apos;s world , the advertising . </s>
as i said , i &apos;ve been in some pretty awful time , but nothing could never get me to anything , nothing could be so difficult and so dangerous to these guys and so dangerous . </s>
you know , i had the idea for a movie . </s>
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , which is the whole thing financed by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising . </s>
and the movie is called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
what &apos;s in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything that all goes up to the top , from the beginning to the bottom from the beginning to the bottom from the beginning to the end of the beginning . </s>
now , this brand , the <unk> <unk> center , the <unk> center ... </s>
these people are being connected to the movie in the united states -- forever . </s>
and so the movie is this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , for the sake of eternity ? </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> person . </s>
that was the <unk> . </s>
it was in eternity , for me . &quot; </s>
but we &apos;re not only the brand x as <unk> , but we &apos;ll be able to ensure that we can actually sell any possible for the movie in the movie . </s>
so we &apos;re so , as maybe we &apos;re so selling the greatest thing , the greatest shoe of shoe , the they have ever been given ... </s>
the greatest car that they ever are , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest <unk> drink &quot; the greatest drink that they &apos;ve ever had , a <unk> drink . &quot; </s>
so the idea is , apart from being a part of life that brands is actually a part of life , you can get to fund the movie ? </s>
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works . </s>
the goal of the whole movie is transparency . </s>
they &apos;ll walk the whole thing in the movie . </s>
so this is the whole concept of the whole film , from the beginning to end . </s>
and i would be thrilled if i could help it , it &apos;s going to help . </s>
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i heard it first , it &apos;s funny respect for the audience . </s>
i don &apos;t know how to be people . </s>
they have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use the perspective , because it has a negative <unk> -- but you know how that &apos;s going to be done ? </s>
how much money is required to realize that we could take action to the mind ? </s>
1.5 million . </s>
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s definitely on every case , some really famous , some really famous . </s>
i know , when video comes out , we may see how a <unk> <unk> looks like a <unk> <unk> . </s>
what do you think about the answer ? </s>
the answer is probably not &quot; a &quot; no . &quot; </s>
but is it a difficult thing to me , or a tough thing to me ? </s>
jk : both . </s>
so ... so , it &apos;s not going to be the case . </s>
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help . </s>
i can help . </s>
okay . </s>
fantastic . </s>
we need to think about what &apos;s going on . </s>
yes . </s>
when you look at people , you know , they have ... </s>
there are some places that we can apply to the . </s>
they make the camera off . </s>
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera from &quot; dignity , we wanted to be a <unk> . </s>
and it turned out that it &apos;s actually meant in fact , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot; </s>
and just as the disappeared disappeared , one after the other , one after the other . </s>
no wanted to do something about the movie . </s>
i was amazed . </s>
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project . </s>
and i was confused , because i thought i thought the whole concept of advertising as possible to grow so many people as possible , there are so many people like possible . </s>
particularly in the world , in this sense of new media and ancient media and ancient media and ancient media , is not the idea to be able to ensure that the crowds of crowds . </s>
no , that was what i thought . </s>
but look , the problem was that my idea was to have a <unk> error , and that was the one . </s>
actually , no one was not mistakes . </s>
this would be at all the time . </s>
that would be fine . </s>
but what &apos;s a problem . </s>
you see if you &apos;re transparency at the <unk> , it &apos;s the first images that appears to be one of the first images . </s>
i really like your own way . </s>
that was the problem : transparency of deception -- free of deception and <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> , immediately , just vision of <unk> -- the last line is certainly surely the biggest issue . </s>
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency . </s>
our politicians say , our president tells us , even our ceos say . </s>
but when it comes to the extent , something that is implemented , changing . </s>
but why ? well transparency is <unk> -- like this strange bear , the <unk> , the <unk> . </s>
she &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> . </s>
and she &apos;s also very risky . </s>
what is still predictable ? </s>
a whole <unk> food industry . </s>
this is very risky . </s>
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell these story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to have a story . </s>
we want you to tell a story , but we want you to see that you &apos;re telling our story . &quot; </s>
see , when i was a kid , and my father was lying me lying in my lying -- and there he looks at looking at my view and looking at me , &quot; my son , there are three versions of every story . </s>
there are your version , there are my version , and there are the real version . &quot; </s>
so you see , with this film we wanted to tell the true version of the story . </s>
but there &apos;s a company , a agency ready to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been served for john , and i realized that i had to do that , i realized that i had to do it alone and directly with my team . </s>
so what you &apos;re doing was all of a sudden , or what i started to understand -- was that when you start thinking with these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a bad issue . </s>
i have friends , the big , clean , and i have friends , the little <unk> of the little <unk> as i do . </s>
and my friends , the big , theoretical <unk> , say that the reason , why your movies so successful , why your movies you have . </s>
and then my friends , the little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot; </s>
and the movie is &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
so , as we are , we &apos;ll see the movie of the movie ? </s>
whenever i get to the journey , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see the <unk> , you see the <unk> . </s>
and every time i &apos;m somebody , i can say , &quot; are you happy enough for this interview ? </s>
they are at the way you see a little bit nervous . </s>
i want to help you . </s>
so maybe you should interview the interview . &quot; </s>
and then we provide a great <unk> . </s>
either you can be <unk> fusion or a &quot; <unk> &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choice . </s>
we &apos;re going to be both for men as well as women -- in addition to his <unk> , or a stick , whatever . </s>
this is the <unk> . </s>
now i can answer all their questions and give them a <unk> keyboard . </s>
we are a smaller token . </s>
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are considered we considered a <unk> . </s>
so we &apos;re not so <unk> as a budget . </s>
so these things are doing things -- you know , people &apos;s interested -- that &apos;s kind of what we &apos;re interested in . </s>
with what they would describe in the words would be ? </s>
it &apos;s <unk> . </s>
this is a great question . </s>
woman technology : technology . </s>
technology is not the way to describe something like that should be able to describe it under the <unk> . </s>
we talk about <unk> , fresh . </s>
i think , &quot; a fresh word is that this category exists to something positive , unlike the odor and the moisture . &quot; </s>
it keeps you . </s>
how can we keep them longer , better than better , more fresh times , three times . </s>
these things have effects of a <unk> effect . </s>
and this is a <unk> . </s>
what about the <unk> ? what about the <unk> ? </s>
i have to talk to the road on the road , which is that the way i did , <unk> . </s>
she &apos;s telling me something about my brand . </s>
you know how to describe your brand ? </s>
hmmm , my brand ? </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
i really like to make beautiful beautiful . </s>
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , except at the time . </s>
well , what is the brand <unk> ? </s>
unique nerve . </s>
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is arguably , is arguably glamour . </s>
i like many black colors , many <unk> and so forth . </s>
but i normally have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and so forth . </s>
she said , if you had a brand , he probably would be a classic <unk> <unk> . </s>
i was two : the brand i &apos;m going to say , i &apos;d say , <unk> fly . </s>
girl was partly , partly , partly , partly <unk> , partly -- i don &apos;t know . </s>
man three : i am the <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m bringing <unk> in the country , the world &apos;s worldwide country . </s>
so i think that &apos;s my brand . </s>
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry . </s>
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was <unk> . </s>
man : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
is that ? </s>
attorney : i &apos;m a <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m tom . </s>
now we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i see myself at the interface of glamour and <unk> fly and <unk> . </s>
and what &apos;s even more like me , i needed a domain . </s>
i could be told somebody who could really help me what to help me what &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot; </s>
and so i found a company called <unk> in <unk> . </s>
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , these <unk> . </s>
if you could help me too , too , could also help me . </s>
they &apos;ve brought their pictures , yes ? </s>
i &apos;ve got . the first picture of my family was a picture of my family . </s>
tell me a little bit of how that happens to their mind and feelings about them . </s>
these are the people who form my worldview . </s>
tell me about the world . </s>
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world that live in humans -- how people around the world , the way you live . </s>
all of these things , and start from a place and for me , and i &apos;m going to start with my family in west virginia . </s>
what &apos;s next to talk about you . </s>
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life . </s>
in what context is to say that the idea of self ? </s>
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be . </s>
i like things that are . </s>
i like things that are . i like to get things . </s>
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what makes you ? </s>
what is the <unk> ? in which <unk> are you right now ? </s>
why is it important , <unk> ? what about the red ? </s>
tell me a little bit about this part . </s>
a little bit about you that are not they . </s>
what else they did is they &apos;re supposed to be different ? </s>
... that &apos;s not a fear of his , in which kind of rollercoaster like rollercoaster ? </s>
thank you , thank you ! </s>
thanks for your patience . </s>
yes . now , good . </s>
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done . </s>
quite beautiful things about it . </s>
the first thing i saw was that their <unk> of two <unk> of two , but the sides of the pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / brand <unk> / brand . </s>
the very good ones . </s>
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction . </s>
and i think some companies will be just focused on a strength , rather than both . </s>
a lot of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re going to avoid , they &apos;re going to be scared , and they can actually turn them for themselves in a slightly more <unk> . </s>
what other brands act is like ? </s>
the first one is a classic , apple . </s>
and you can see it here , <unk> , wii , mini mini and <unk> . </s>
now , there are <unk> brands , and <unk> brands , these things that come together and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a very strong thing . </s>
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ? </s>
if somebody would ask you to describe your spouse , your <unk> , how would you do ? </s>
you &apos;re a <unk> ? you &apos;re seeing something that blood flow into the <unk> ? </s>
or are you more likely to be a <unk> ? </s>
are something that &apos;s a little bit , <unk> , conservative , conservative , conservative is conservative . </s>
<unk> are things that are <unk> , fresh <unk> , fresh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . </s>
or are you more like a <unk> ? </s>
are they <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ? </s>
they &apos;re called , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate , compassionate like oprah ? </s>
they are <unk> , stable , safe , safe , holy , <unk> , etc , and how the dalai lama or <unk> ? </s>
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that were up and the <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said &quot; no , because they weren &apos;t going to be part of the project . </s>
they wanted to do anything with this film because they don &apos;t have control control , no control over the product . </s>
but it &apos;s been 17 <unk> that were willing to dispense with someone to dispense with someone with someone businesses and a half that could make us feel like i couldn &apos;t tell stories -- stories that we normally not have -- stories that would ordinarily be able to tell a <unk> never . </s>
they &apos;re <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , so the way we tell the story in this movie that you use to use the <unk> of the brain stem cells , both of them . </s>
we went to sao where <unk> was banned . </s>
in the city of city , since five years , five years , no poster , no poster , nothing . </s>
and we &apos;re starting to be in the u.s. where companies were in <unk> schools in america . </s>
the incredible thing for me is that the projects of which i got to be done by the way most of the feedback i had to succeed with things like things like things . </s>
and that &apos;s what these brands have done , and that &apos;s what these brands did . </s>
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the brain , and said that the agencies may not be the interest in the mind . </s>
i &apos;m going to talk with the artist . </s>
i &apos;m going to work with him and something perfectly different , something that people think that we think , that people will take our way . </s>
and how did it succeed ? what it does ? </s>
now , since the movie , the movie had <unk> <unk> <unk> , we can look at the look at the time . </s>
according to the <unk> , the <unk> in january , and since then -- and this is not even though the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this movie . </s>
this is just a matter of two weeks . </s>
this is just online -- no press , no television . </s>
the movie hasn &apos;t been left . </s>
there &apos;s no <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s not going to come together . </s>
well , finally , the movie was a very big deal . </s>
and that &apos;s not a bad project , where any <unk> <unk> that we talked about , their customers have been to make it . </s>
something i &apos;m sure , is that if you &apos;re having a chance to get your chance to take risks that have a lot of possibilities in these risks . </s>
i think if you &apos;re people about people , you get closer to the failure . </s>
i think that if you &apos;re trying to avoid your staff , you have to avoid the whole company , you know , you know . </s>
i have the feeling that we have to encourage people to encourage people to the <unk> . </s>
we have to encourage people to do fear that may have opportunities that you may may have may not have . </s>
finally , we should embrace the fear of the fear . </s>
we should put the bear in the cage . </s>
welcome to fear . they risk the risk of <unk> . </s>
so , at a big , big , we &apos;re called the risk of energy . </s>
and finally , we should embrace welcome . </s>
today , more than the age of that , which is a little bit of a lot of very far . </s>
and the <unk> , my talk talk , &quot; she says &quot; she &apos;s transparency , &quot; i got transparency , &quot; got she &apos;s transparency from my good friends for the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
great data is all around the world in large opportunities . </s>
transparency : &quot; hot &quot; hot spots &quot; </s>
thank you very much . </s>
well , morgan , in the name of transparency , which is now right now with the $ <unk> ? </s>
this is a great question . </s>
i have a leader , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in dollars to fund my <unk> next year . </s>
my name is <unk> . </s>
18 months ago , i did something else , i was seeing something else to the dismay , and i &apos;m <unk> to make something with museums and art that &apos;s been here , there was no light . </s>
and it took 18 months . </s>
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories that can i tell you , with 17 very interesting museums . </s>
but i &apos;m going to focus on the screening . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this . </s>
i think my personal is very simple with this slide and their access to mit access . </s>
i grew up in india . </s>
i was a great education , a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had to have this particular one . </s>
and then i went to visit this museums , i started a lot to learn a lot of learning . </s>
and while i worked for google , i tried to lead to art -- art can lead to art . </s>
we called a team , a great big , and we started to start with the <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration of the demonstration , and you tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch . </s>
so you &apos;re just going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> . </s>
you can take all this museums here . </s>
there is the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh . </s>
i actually come in one of my favorite , the main museum of art in new york . </s>
you get very simple for two ways -- very simple . </s>
<unk> , and <unk> , is you &apos;re in this museum . </s>
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , the most important , the odds , it doesn &apos;t make a difference . </s>
you go around and have it . </s>
they want to orient in the museum ? </s>
open up the map , and you &apos;ve got it with a click . </s>
and they are in the end of the gangs . </s>
just keep it . </s>
they &apos;re building them . </s>
thank you , but the best thing is . </s>
now i &apos;m a <unk> of my favorite , <unk> <unk> in the bookstore . </s>
i see this <unk> . </s>
if the museum has given us the image of it , it &apos;s looking at it . </s>
this is a little bit of the pictures . </s>
there are all kinds of metadata . </s>
and of you , the really interested in art , can be here , but i &apos;m going to throw it away . </s>
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been called with the so-called <unk> . </s>
this image for example , about 10 billion <unk> , i think , &quot; i believe . </s>
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get to 10 billion ? &quot; </s>
now i &apos;m going to show you , &quot; i &apos;m going to show you . </s>
you can browse , and <unk> . </s>
you can see something funny here . </s>
i love this guy ; his expression is transformational . </s>
but then they want to really work . </s>
and so i started to play on being a <unk> and that was something that &apos;s happening . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot; </s>
i was close to the other kids who actually saw this children . </s>
i &apos;m a little bit , talking with a few known with a few <unk> in the met , and it turns out that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , which is a goose with a stick index . </s>
it was quite popular . </s>
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned about it . </s>
to go to the <unk> , you can go to the cracks . </s>
just to give you the way , i &apos;m looking out , you know , what you get . </s>
here we were , and this is the paintings . </s>
the best thing is , but -- in a second . </s>
let &apos;s quickly jump to the moma , again in new york . </s>
another <unk> of mine , <unk> . </s>
in the beginning , i was able to find out , was about the detail . </s>
but what if you want to see the <unk> ? </s>
and what if you want to see the van gogh , because of that , they have a little like this ? </s>
you really go in . you really go in . </s>
i &apos;m going to be in a friend of mine this image , until i really <unk> the <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> , probably never seen before . </s>
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function . </s>
there are many more than another , but i don &apos;t have time . </s>
this is really cool , he &apos;s got collections . </s>
everybody from you , everybody -- is a very wonderful , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter whether they &apos;re a great house . </s>
you can make a movement and online <unk> , from all these pictures , you can do their own collection . </s>
just simply go , and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can browse . </s>
that &apos;s the <unk> &apos; s , in the <unk> . </s>
you can see all of these friends , their friends , and so a conversation about what you feel when they &apos;re feeling like this , and feel like this masterpieces . </s>
i think , finally , is that the main thing that all the wonderful things are not going to come from google . </s>
she &apos;s not going to come out of the museums . </s>
i should not say that . </s>
they come from the statistics . </s>
and that was a experience for me . </s>
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to hope that the arts are the arts , and it &apos;s used online , it &apos;s online . </s>
what is the big question that i asked myself was to be asked , &quot; did you have this to replicate a <unk> experience of a <unk> . &quot; </s>
the answer is no . </s>
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience . </s>
it &apos;s about . thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
this is a plot of their brain . your brain can be done in two camps . </s>
this is the left half half the logical side and then the rights half that are the intuitive . </s>
if we could have a scale to measure the <unk> of each other , we could measure your brain . </s>
for example , it &apos;s completely logical , and it &apos;s completely consistent . </s>
this is somebody who is completely intuitive . </s>
well , where would you take your brain on this scale ? </s>
some of us may have been interested in one of those extremes , but i think that most people in the audience , you know , most people in the audience , you know , with a high <unk> that &apos;s in both <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so . </s>
they can be transparent and intuitively . </s>
and so i see myself as a person , collectively with most other experimental <unk> of most other <unk> , which is a good proportion of logic together . </s>
but at the same time we need a good intuition to have the experiments . </s>
how do we do that intuition ? well , we love it to play with things . </s>
so we go out and play and look like it , and then we start to develop where we are there . </s>
basically , the same thing . </s>
so one of the things that you &apos;ve been evolving about the years is probably that one thing to be a place to be a place to be a place in the same time . </s>
i mean , it can be strange to think that a thing is at the same time , but they were having with this idea of different places , but they were born with this idea of being born . </s>
i remember a child playing on a <unk> . </s>
he was still a kind of <unk> and not very good at all in it . </s>
but i bet it was a very valuable lesson with the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the great things you don &apos;t just go over and that it doesn &apos;t just stay in a place . </s>
and this is a great model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a <unk> model . </s>
it would be a <unk> model for a <unk> because they weren &apos;t using <unk> playing with these little particles , but with these little bits of weird particles . </s>
and when you play with your particles , you can all kinds of weird things -- how they &apos;re directly right through the walls , or that they &apos;re going to be a <unk> of two different places . </s>
and so they all started this observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics . </s>
this was the state of physics in front of the physics ; you needed to get the little bits of the little bits . </s>
but you didn &apos;t need the big mundane way around us . </s>
that didn &apos;t mean , and that &apos;s not just because i &apos;m not going to play with particles . </s>
well , i &apos;m sometimes with you , but not very often . </s>
and i &apos;ve never seen them . </s>
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle . </s>
but my logical page of it hasn &apos;t been . </s>
because if all things are made up from particles and all this <unk> the rules of quantum mechanics , then , then it &apos;s not just the rules of quantum mechanics ? </s>
i don &apos;t see why it should not be so be that . </s>
so i &apos;d better feel much better with the whole thing that we can show , that <unk> rules also the rules of quantum mechanics . </s>
so i made a couple of years ago , i made it right now . </s>
i created one . </s>
this is the first object that you can see that in the <unk> <unk> . </s>
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip . </s>
and you can see this green and see the middle of the center there . </s>
this is the piece of the things i &apos;m going to talk about . </s>
this is a picture of the object . </s>
here i &apos;m a little bit of a bit . we &apos;re looking at the center . </s>
and here is a really big close-up of this little piece of <unk> . </s>
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , like a springboard , and it &apos;s about the edge of a little over the edge . </s>
so i made this thing that you &apos;re a chip chip . </s>
i went to a clean space with new <unk> and <unk> for 100 hours to be able to build all the big brands . </s>
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to take this <unk> pool and the thing . </s>
this thing has been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do a little help . </s>
look for a analogy . </s>
you know how it is in a crowded elevator ? </s>
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in my taste , i do all kinds of weird stuff , but then i hear all kinds of things , and i hear them to make all kinds of things , or frankly , she said , frankly , she &apos;s <unk> . </s>
quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just as comfortable . </s>
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not just human , but also the light that you seem to be in the wind and the wind &apos;s heat . </s>
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece metal <unk> , we had to have the whole <unk> <unk> of the whole <unk> . </s>
and we did . </s>
we have light , put it into a vacuum and <unk> <unk> , the whole vacuum , and <unk> it up to almost the <unk> air , the play , the play of free , the way it was . </s>
so we measured his movement . </s>
we found that it &apos;s really moving . </s>
instead of that , it &apos;s simply a simple thing , it &apos;s like this , the way it was about as a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and combined <unk> <unk> . </s>
we could put a little car , we could have the same time to vibrate and not knowing -- something which is just about quantum mechanics . </s>
so what really do i do is fantastic . </s>
what does it mean for a more object to the same time , and not too utilitarian ? </s>
let &apos;s think about the atoms . </s>
so the first case , all the regions of atoms are made from atoms and the same time , the same atoms are getting up and down the same atoms . </s>
just to be able to get them . </s>
the rest of you are <unk> . </s>
that is that every atom is at the same time , two different places that are at the same time , which is that the whole thing is metal , metal chunk in two different places . </s>
i think that &apos;s cool . </s>
really . </s>
it was worth me for all of these year in the middle space <unk> <unk> , because , check the one that &apos;s between a single atom and this piece is about as much as the tune of the tune of the tune and you . </s>
so if any of the atom is two different places that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see why they weren &apos;t ? </s>
i mean , this is just what my logical page says . </s>
so , imagine you would be a long way of seeing multiple times of places like that ? </s>
how your consciousness is that your body &apos;s body in the room ? </s>
there is a different aspect of history . </s>
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and box and box , saw that the piece metal and saw that the piece metal still in a piece was . </s>
and so i had to understand this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the dense in which you actually are in fact only objects that are in a small space station . </s>
you hear a lot of talking about how quantum mechanics is that everything connected to everything everything is linked . </s>
now , that &apos;s not quite a really , really , really , really , really . </s>
there is more still deeper . </s>
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things they are around , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and the strange industry . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
in 2007 , i decided that we should have the <unk> to be more important . </s>
it should be that our goal , if families think about it , where they live in and work , and they want to work on at least one hand , between at least one hand that all the people in the city of care . </s>
in the moment we &apos;re at the goal of this goal . </s>
there are billions of people in developing countries , who doesn &apos;t even have a single city to the city of the time . </s>
but the amazing thing is that they are worth more value than it costs to build it . </s>
so we could easily the world very easily with <unk> , perhaps <unk> hundreds of new cities . </s>
now , this sounds like absurd now to have new cities , but never have new cities . </s>
they just simply get the construction against the surface of the cities . </s>
imagine that half of people who want to live in life , do this already , but that &apos;s already not yet . </s>
you could actually build the capacity of existing <unk> . </s>
but you know what they &apos;d been seeing , in these apartments and their environment to avoid the environment , and the imf is to avoid the imf . </s>
so it turns out , so heavy , all these different smells . </s>
but you could go to a whole new place , a whole new new place , and he provided a whole new way of making a construction support and not . </s>
so i suggested that governments have new spaces , which is enough space for a city , and gives you a name to make a name . </s>
i found that , for example , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of a reform in honduras . </s>
she knew that every year of labor labor is their country to come in , and they wanted to know what they could stay in the country and the same thing they could stay in their country and precisely the same in the middle . </s>
at this point , <unk> said , &quot; what if we were going to work under the canadian embassy , &quot; what if we just want to work under the canadian embassy , a part of our most important <unk> , and when people are working under the area of this mammal , they can do anything about canada ? &quot; </s>
in the summer of the <unk> <unk> . </s>
in the next season , won &apos;t <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , whose program both <unk> both . </s>
he &apos;s delighted to be <unk> . </s>
in tedglobal , i &apos;m tedglobal with tedglobal , in tedglobal . </s>
by improvement , and through improvement , i have to have this complicated concept of the <unk> city of the <unk> city of the <unk> city . </s>
the first point is the importance of laws that are determine , that you don &apos;t need to <unk> <unk> , you can &apos;t make the existing way . </s>
we &apos;re giving new technology technology , but for the progress , it &apos;s working for the progress of technology , and it &apos;s all the way to express us . </s>
in the autumn , a friend of guatemala , <unk> link to the tedtalk . </s>
the one thing it showed him . </s>
the two keeps me . </s>
and said , &quot; let &apos;s get the <unk> of our country &quot; . &quot; </s>
so we met in december of december in december of the hotels in miami . </s>
i &apos;ve tried to make clear how valuable cities are , to how much more valuable than they are . </s>
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is to be a place like new york . think that one area in some cases per square meter of dollars value . </s>
but it was a quite abstract of discussion , at one point when it was a break , a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , could we feel the tedtalk . &quot; </s>
so the tedtalk was very simple in very simple form , that a <unk> city is a place that is the <unk> city , which is the law of the law , and the people who will determine to determine those rules or not . </s>
so , i was asked by the president of honduras , the extent that we have to get this project , that it &apos;s important to bring this way that it &apos;s important to us to get to our country . </s>
i was asked to come to come up with <unk> and fifth at the fourth and fifth . </s>
so i have a different talk talk about the facts of the economic talk , which is a graph like this economic system that tries to realize that if you want to have value value in a city , it has a very big city . </s>
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch of the new airport was built in <unk> . </s>
and he &apos;s been a <unk> percent of the 100 <unk> . </s>
so i tried to convince you the <unk> of it , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s more than a thousand morning . </s>
so polite all the <unk> . </s>
the faces were very serious and it &apos;s taken . </s>
the director of the congress came up with the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you so much , i thank you with a talk , but could we look at the tedtalk . </s>
i have him here on my laptop . &quot; </s>
so i &apos;ve got to get back the tedtalk . </s>
and i was invited to the bug that a new city has been to offer people new opportunities . </s>
it was the possibility of a city in honduras , rather than in honduras , instead of miles away from the north . </s>
and a new city includes new ways for executives for organizing a lot . </s>
the leaders of the government in honduras for <unk> <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , and at the intersection , they would be able to learn that everyone really can be true . </s>
and the lesson of president <unk> was that the leaders of the <unk> , that the <unk> of the <unk> of the day i &apos;ve got to give to the <unk> investors of what to build , for all of years , and he was suffering . </s>
we &apos;re in territory . </s>
this picture is from this place . </s>
it &apos;s called a thousand kilometers . </s>
and shortly after that 19th january , in the 19th , they have been congress to have a change in order to have a <unk> set of uninterrupted time that &apos;s a special <unk> <unk> . </s>
in a country that &apos;s just a <unk> crisis in the congress , with <unk> <unk> to a voice . </s>
all of the parties , all the <unk> of society , at this . </s>
to become part of the constitution , but it needs twice by the congress . </s>
february 4th , it was a second time to a voice , a voice , bruce . </s>
immediately after that choice , between 30 and the gulf of february , traveled to about 30 percent of about 30 percent of the world that were most interested in the store . </s>
one place in a plastic place . </s>
this is a picture of a large number of urban , new health , which built in southern sudan , <unk> <unk> . </s>
all of you can see what you can see , within four years , has been built in the last year , after the four years to preserve the permissions . </s>
the other place that &apos;s very interested in , singapore . </s>
it &apos;s already two cities in china and the third is in preparation . </s>
so when you see , we &apos;re basically thinking about where we are . </s>
they have already got a <unk> ; and they &apos;ve got this area to the second city . </s>
it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , that <unk> allows , and it &apos;s also going to be a domestic tool . </s>
a country has already offered his last page to be passionate about the <unk> appeal of the internet . </s>
also , <unk> and <unk> are very interested in . </s>
they even funding it with a . </s>
one thing you already know , is , there &apos;s lots of <unk> , there &apos;s lots of <unk> . </s>
there are many stars that people would like to be in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who love to live there . </s>
all over the world there are 700 million people who are looking at the same location to another place . </s>
a million people leave a month and taken into the united states . </s>
many of you are fathers who are forced to their family , their families were brought to <unk> themselves , they have been mothers to make money and donating clothing . </s>
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes sometimes children who are trying to find their parents that have been in some cases , since some of the decade , in some cases , since you haven &apos;t seen . </s>
what is it that &apos;s a idea to build it in honduras for a completely new city ? </s>
or even <unk> from those cities , or hundreds of all the intricacies ? </s>
so what &apos;s it is , what is it for a idea that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in the competition around the competition in the competition . </s>
this is a idea that &apos;s worth spreading . </s>
my friends from honduras me to say thank you . </s>
you know how many decisions you do about a typical day ? </s>
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ? </s>
i &apos;ve been talking about 2,000 people with 2,000 americans and the average number of choices that are <unk> a typical american american on a day , is a typical american sense of a day . </s>
and he was a study with ceos in a week with ceos in the ceos for a week . </s>
and these scientists have just the various topics of which these particular <unk> <unk> , and how much time they make the way they make the way that the topics of the themes . </s>
and they have found that a typical expression of <unk> in the week with <unk> tasks . </s>
each of these issues , of course , many smaller decisions . </s>
50 percent of the choices have been about nine minutes or less . </s>
only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they have a hour or more of their time . </s>
think of your own decisions . </s>
you know how many decisions you have to make category in the nine minutes of the nine minutes ? </s>
how good , you know , are you going to cope with the conclusion ? </s>
today i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern <unk> of our modern time . </s>
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions . </s>
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to show you some questions and i want to know some questions . </s>
if i want to ask you a question , you get to , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to take some calories . </s>
so , i ask you when i &apos;m going to ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question for today &apos;s -- are you ready to hear about the <unk> ? </s>
thank you very much . </s>
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i was walking to this very , very little , very interesting , at least at least at least at the time he was really , really . </s>
it was a store of the <unk> . </s>
this business model almost like a <unk> . </s>
they had 250 species of mustard and <unk> and <unk> and more than two dozen of fruits and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and more than two dozen of a time . </s>
i &apos;m going to go to this business , but at a time i wondered , well , how do you feel like you never do anything ? </s>
here &apos;s the olive oil . </s>
they had over 75 different varieties of different varieties of the olive oil , including those who were locked from thousands of years . </s>
so i decided to visit one day to visit the months , and i was asked to the leader , &quot; works this model that you really ought to offer all those possibilities ? &quot; </s>
and he showed up the <unk> of tourists who came every day and they &apos;d just like their cameras . </s>
we decided to do an experiment and we chose to experiment for our experiment . </s>
here &apos;s her favorite fish . </s>
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> . </s>
we have a little <unk> right at the entrance . </s>
we have six different varieties of <unk> or 24 different varieties of <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : one more people , one more people , are going to stay alive and more holistic ? </s>
there are more people , stayed with 60 percent when it were six , about 60 percent of them when it were six to about 40 percent . </s>
and then we saw a way to happen in which case people more <unk> . </s>
now we saw the temperature . </s>
people who stayed in the face of the 24 , bought three percent actually had a glass of <unk> . </s>
people who stayed in the face of being six , now we saw that 30 percent of you actually have a glass of <unk> . </s>
now , if you calculate it , it &apos;s the people who were having the people who had been a glass <unk> , who had to have the choices when they were to the selection . </s>
now , not to make a glass of <unk> , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our invention -- but it turns out that the <unk> will also make us in a very unfair way to make it very much decisions . </s>
we don &apos;t decide to decide even if it &apos;s against our own best interests . </s>
so the subject to the day . </s>
i &apos;m going to show you a survey that i &apos;m going to describe with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we have the choices for almost a million , in the whole world . </s>
and what we did was whether the number of <unk> that could be possible in a <unk> possible , the <unk> plan , the chance of influences , whether it &apos;s going to be tomorrow . </s>
and we found that it was actually done , in fact , and we found that it was done . </s>
so in this way , we had about <unk> people who have been so <unk> with the two things that have been done between two to the different selves . </s>
and what we found was that the more convinced ever were more , in fact , the participation was lower . </s>
if you look at the extremes , the plans that have two main language , a <unk> in the &apos; 70s -- still not so high , we want to be so high as high as we want it . </s>
in the plans that almost 60 60 , the <unk> now is on the <unk> <unk> . </s>
now , that even if you feel more about when you feel more options , if more ways to get to the choices , even it has been negative consequences . </s>
so people who decided to feel like , more of the more choices , the more opportunities to have the more more relevant to the more . </s>
the more options opportunities , the more they were more options in pure <unk> , in pure <unk> . </s>
no of these extreme decisions , who would recommend that somebody else &apos;s recommend when the future is important . </s>
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve been studying three times a negative exchange of the consequences that are required to offer the fabulous of more choices . </s>
they &apos;re doing a decision -- they &apos;re doing , even if you &apos;re interested in , even if you &apos;re going to change your own . </s>
they are often more accurate , and worse medical decisions , they &apos;re often <unk> . </s>
they decide to decide to make them less happy , even if you make it better . </s>
the main reason is that we &apos;re going to take us these huge <unk> of these huge <unk> of <unk> , mustard and <unk> , and then <unk> , but we can &apos;t see the comparison and then something from the amazing offer . </s>
so what i want to show you is the most simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways -- techniques we tested in the store . </s>
first of all , the time . </s>
you &apos;ve heard before , but it was never true as today , that less than today , that less than today . </s>
people are always worried when i say , &quot; stop . &quot; </s>
they &apos;re worried about losing <unk> . </s>
but in fact , we see it more and more and more and more , that if they &apos;re willing to be ready , and the <unk> gets opportunities , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it will be the cost of the cost , &amp; amp ; d . </s>
and then , as a <unk> and gamble , the different neuron and the various <unk> species of 26 on 15 percent . </s>
when the golden <unk> corporation was 10 to her 10 percent of the <unk> <unk> , they were the burning to 70 percent of their sales -- a result of the sales and reducing costs . </s>
you know , the average <unk> gives you a products of education . </s>
a typical walmart gives you today . </s>
but the <unk> supermarket , the world today is <unk> , and they &apos;re offering them , they &apos;re just <unk> for products -- a kind of tomato sauce in the mirror . </s>
now in the world of the <unk> , i believe one of the best examples that came to the market , which is how you &apos;ve got best to come back to the market , which is very strong , it &apos;s a program that david <unk> has been going on at harvard . </s>
every single one of the harvard that takes now is automatically <unk> . </s>
and that &apos;s really a selection , really 20 , 20 or more fund . </s>
you know , how people are often saying , &quot; i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to go to . </s>
it &apos;s all the important possibilities . &quot; </s>
and the first thing i &apos;m saying , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other is different . </s>
and if their staff don &apos;t <unk> , they can &apos;t do it . &quot; </s>
now , before we started having a conversation with gary , i had a conversation with gary . </s>
and gary said , he &apos;d be ready to all of everybody in this audience , <unk> <unk> , the most beautiful , the most beautiful road . </s>
here &apos;s a description of the street . </s>
and i want to read you to read . </s>
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i ask you to clap you if they &apos;re ready to clap if they &apos;re ready . </s>
okay . everybody &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
are all the stuff ? </s>
well , let me show you a little bit of it . </s>
they knew it was a trick , right ? </s>
now , who is ready for this journey . </s>
i think i &apos;ve heard you may have heard more . </s>
good . </s>
in fact , it &apos;s objective to the first time more information about the first time , but i &apos;d be able to guess it &apos;s going to be a second , but i would guess it &apos;s a second thing that you could actually do . </s>
because the pictures was interested in for them . </s>
what excites me to do is engineering , which helps you think about that problem with the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between the individual choices , which are the consequences with individual choices , and that &apos;s the consequences and the consequences are going to be a very different and going to be a <unk> and a sense of . </s>
why americans are people $ 15 or 30 percent more than a <unk> or a sustainable number of times that was in ? </s>
because it &apos;s not we going to make money . </s>
and it turns out that if you can do it , it &apos;s a very good tool to save it a very good tool to save people more . </s>
so we &apos;ve made a study that i had <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve got a study with the people in <unk> -- who worked all in one gathering in one gathering , and these people were all in one gathering in the <unk> . </s>
and during that meeting , we &apos;ve been able to acknowledge these things just as they were always , just we have a little more low . </s>
the more we have been crippled in the way we &apos;ve been asked to do the people , just thinking of all positive things that would happen in their lives when they save money . </s>
in that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation about 20 percent and there were a rise of the number of people who were ready to save or a five-meter rise of the <unk> . </s>
third technology : <unk> . </s>
we can deal with more categories than with more choices . </s>
here &apos;s the case for example , a study that we did in a <unk> . </s>
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> ocean and below the northeast sector , varies the number of numbers between the <unk> species of magazines . </s>
but you know what ? </s>
if i &apos;m going to show you 600 magazines , and they &apos;re in 10 categories , or i &apos;m showing you that i would have 400 magazines , and i have a better magazines for me to give you more choice and a better <unk> , when i gave them 600 600 times . </s>
because the categories of me is like you can see them . </s>
here &apos;s two different <unk> . </s>
one means &quot; jazz &quot; and the other &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot; </s>
if you think the left is the left display , and the ad is jazz , they clapping in the hands . </s>
okay , there &apos;s a couple of . </s>
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and the right side of <unk> is , you clapping . </s>
okay , a few more . </s>
well , it turns out , in fact , you have right now . </s>
the one on the left is jazz and the on the right , but you know what ? </s>
this is a <unk> <unk> . </s>
the categories of the <unk> is not the selection of the difference . </s>
and this problem , you see the long tail , if you look at the long lists of all this individual . </s>
who do you really want to take care of that ? </s>
fourth technology : a <unk> for complexity . </s>
it turns out that we can take more information than we think we &apos;re thinking , we just need to simplify it . </s>
we have to increase the complexity . </s>
i &apos;m showing you a example of what i mean . </s>
let &apos;s give a very , very complicated choice : the purchase of a car . </s>
here &apos;s a german <unk> who provides the opportunity to <unk> her car . </s>
you have to make a nonprofit set of your car to design your car . </s>
now , these decisions in the number of choice they are choosing to offer them per choice . </s>
<unk> , <unk> of cars -- i have 56 opportunities . </s>
motors engines -- four options . </s>
what i &apos;m doing now is , i &apos;m a <unk> in the choices . </s>
half of the customers are going to have been about the many ways , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the low . </s>
the other half of customers are about the low possibilities , four of the <unk> , many ways . </s>
what do i look at ? </s>
how they are . </s>
if you &apos;re looking at the <unk> , that &apos;s the that they &apos;re going to be a little bit of <unk> , the <unk> , i &apos;m just blown away . </s>
what she is doing is that the people who go from many to the low and keep the <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ll lose it . </s>
go to the many , then they stay in the way , and then you stay away from the little choice . </s>
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same amount of possibilities . </s>
the only thing i did , is changing this information . </s>
if i start with the simple voices , i learn how i &apos;m going to <unk> . </s>
even though the things don &apos;t pick me about my writing about my writing in the &apos; 60s , it always makes me . </s>
it puts me to the great product that i &apos;m wearing , and so i &apos;m prepared to be able to make myself to be able to make an interest in the interest . </s>
let me wrap up . </s>
i told you about four techniques who told the problem of the <unk> <unk> -- they &apos;re going to be real ; <unk> -- they &apos;re going to be better ; less -- we can do better categories , less more than complexity -- do you make better more opportunities . </s>
each of those techniques that i think is to give you the opportunity to help them to manage the possibilities -- good for them to manage the opportunity to be good . </s>
because i think the key to the <unk> is that you &apos;re looking at the choices . </s>
and the more we are looking at the age of being the better to be able to be able to make the arts . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube , i &apos;m looking at my <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s true . </s>
today we want to talk about how video games are going to be , and then subsequently , why is that even important . </s>
we all want to be a big part of the <unk> -- a <unk> , comedians , comedians that &apos;s been difficult to do . </s>
but <unk> , we have been that we all have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to become a part of culture in a part of culture . </s>
every single one of you may be famous about the internet until the internet . </s>
but at youtube , we &apos;re still trying to have a minute of the <unk> . </s>
and again , only a tiny percentage of <unk> ever <unk> and will be thousands of times . </s>
so , how does that work ? </s>
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected . </s>
well , we want to take . </s>
oh my god . oh my god . </s>
oh god ! </s>
<unk> ! </s>

but what about this day ? </s>
well , <unk> <unk> , a lot of them , about it . </s>
michael <unk> , nelson from the <unk> science was a first one that was a joke in a joke . </s>
and important is that a <unk> or a group of <unk> you &apos;re going to share with a big audience , and so that &apos;s the process of doing the process . </s>
and then , these kinds of people who shared this community desperately <unk> , and started to deal with it and started to go and <unk> . </s>
now there are 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; at youtube . </s>
and already , in the first seven days , there was a parody for everybody to take care of every single day . </s>

and important is , creativity that creativity that in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> . </s>
there was no . </s>
somebody made a <unk> of it . </s>
and then it became international . </s>
a whole <unk> <unk> <unk> from the ground , which is a little bit of a joke that we can all participate . </s>
today , we find not just a way to do with . </s>
who could have been able to do anything ? </s>
who could have been wrong with the <unk> or rebecca or <unk> <unk> . </s>
and what you can write about what that <unk> <unk> ? </s>
in a world where every single one has been really a single days , only really unique and unexpected <unk> as the ones who have the data . </s>
i &apos;ll admit , i was not a very much interested in telling me when i said a friend i told myself about a guy who &apos;s been talking about a guy who &apos;s been in new york city . </s>
i got a letter , because i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not in the <unk> , but there are no doubt that you can drive a little bit on the <unk> . </s>
and that &apos;s the very surprising thing and it &apos;s been done , was a <unk> <unk> and his argument , five million times . </s>
this approach is true for anything we do about . </s>
and this is all leads to us ... </s>
what does that mean ? </s>

but i remember the lights of <unk> <unk> in the coast coast of the coast coast , and in the young man who was a lot of the first man who died , and he died , the end of the journey was too much for me to be one of the men on the platform of the men . </s>
no one has ever been so embarrassed . </s>
we landed in a refugee camp in melbourne . </s>
and the next generation is about four women in three generations that are going to build a new life . </s>
we were looking at <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> from <unk> . </s>
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence had been completely unknown , there was no <unk> <unk> . </s>
the latest world came out of the world . </s>
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> were among people who were a cause of common : they started . </s>

my mom suffered from the boat . </s>
and it was my task , every night to stay up until her <unk> came to the <unk> , so i could get them to <unk> them . </s>
she &apos;s a <unk> , then a <unk> and a little bit of business . </s>
and the women came to their stories about men who are not <unk> angry , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , imprisoned between worlds . </s>
and they were sought to be a lot . </s>
so many people have been built . </s>
i lived in <unk> . </s>
in one of the classical asian , i was able to graduate student <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
in the other , i was living in natural life , the <unk> scars of violence , the <unk> and the joy . </s>
but many of the years of the year . </s>
and because of this aid , i was in my last year of <unk> as a boy in the year . </s>
and i was convicted by a <unk> for the next one , and the edges of the edges . </s>
tan le , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , was a tan le <unk> , and refugee and social activist that they had never been heard of , and in the pursuit of their existence , whose existence would have been to think about places . </s>
i didn &apos;t really have been familiar with the <unk> . </s>
i don &apos;t know how to use the <unk> . </s>
i don &apos;t know how to speak about wine . </s>
i don &apos;t know how to speak about anything . </s>
i wanted to see my routine and the convenience of the life of a unknown <unk> <unk> <unk> -- a mom and two daughters that came out of their day and <unk> , we still haven &apos;t three and two daughters that came out of their stories . </s>
i was telling you that &apos;s not going to be done . </s>
and she reminded me that i was now as old as they were when we were walking out of that boat . </s>
no way , had never been a possibility . </s>
&quot; do it simply &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re doing . &quot; </s>
so i talked about <unk> and training , and the <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and the more i was talking about , the more i was going to tell . </s>
i met people in all <unk> , so many of you did what they loved , in the limits of the matter . </s>
and while i had my degree , i realized that i could not be able to hold me with a career in the way that i could not be able to hold me with a career . </s>
there had to be another <unk> . </s>
and i realized it &apos;s okay to be okay , a <unk> , new , new zealand , new zealand , but something that you may have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> . </s>
because texting can be easily so easily can be easily , that &apos;s so easily that you can &apos;t easily feel the assumptions of the environment . </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> from my <unk> , that , yes , the world , yes , the world , but not as they <unk> . </s>
opportunities that hasn &apos;t been allowed to have been , actually , the <unk> . </s>
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of humility and the <unk> . </s>
so i followed my gut . </s>
i collected a little team of people who were not to take me to the <unk> of a challenge . </s>
a year we had no cents . </s>
by a every morning i &apos;m a huge dose of the soup we shared . </s>
we worked in the night sky . </s>
most of our ideas were being crazy , but it was a few brilliant and we managed to have the breakthrough . </s>
i met the decision to pull in the u.s. </s>
after just a journey . </s>
my gut is back . </s>
three months later , i was moved to him and the adventure went on . </s>
before i &apos;m going to tell you about my grandmother , i want to tell you about my grandmother . </s>
she grew up at a time when the social norm and the local season was the most important person . </s>
the life had been changed . </s>
her father died at birth to her birth . </s>
her mother was alone . </s>
she was born the second woman of a cartoon , whose mother &apos;s her . </s>
without her , they had a <unk> laser for a <unk> , <unk> him in a <unk> , <unk> , and a more larger than she was going to win . </s>
&quot; it &apos;s like the one . </s>
i just packaged in a hotel in the hotel of the 1,000 . </s>
i looked at the front page of the <unk> and saw them on the other side . </s>
i knew she was coming to a <unk> . </s>
my mom was calling me a few minutes after that . </s>
a few days later , we walked into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her . </s>
we told her stories , we were still at their own . </s>
and then the monk came from the monk and he said he was going to conclude the sounds . </s>
my mom asked us to take her hand . </s>
she said , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her own is so cold ? &quot; </s>
&quot; because she said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; they didn &apos;t have a letter . &quot; </s>
if there is a band of our family , it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s through the women . </s>
you see , who we were looking at who we were having , we can see that the guys who were able to come in , we have to see that the guys who would have been going to come back in the <unk> . </s>
the defeat would have been just been too simple . </s>
now i have my own children , and i think that &apos;s the boat . </s>
who &apos;s ever going to wish to do ? </s>
yes , i &apos;ve been afraid of privilege , ease of <unk> . </s>
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous , every wave of <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the world that didn &apos;t work ? </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
but if i could give this , and it could be safely , i would do it . </s>
and also , <unk> is here today in the fourth room , or fifth . </s>
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you . </s>
is it even photography ? </s>
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t take for the camera . </s>
but nevertheless , my interest in photography began photography when i was my first digital art in the age of 15 years . </s>
i &apos;m highlighting my former predilection of a <unk> , but it was a little different , because the camera was the process of the process in planning . </s>
and if you &apos;re a picture of a camera , and it &apos;s a camera , and it &apos;s a <unk> process when you &apos;re in the trigger . </s>
and for me , it seemed to be more about photography , most of the right place at the right time . </s>
i thought , everybody who is going to be . </s>
so i wanted to create something different , something that &apos;s when the trigger gets to trigger the trigger . </s>
photos as this : a construction page of a much more <unk> . </s>
but it has a unexpected twist . </s>
and <unk> is a realistic level . </s>
or photos like this -- dark and <unk> , but everybody with the common goal , a realistic level of scale , a realistic level of scale . </s>
so , if i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> . </s>
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you really want to be able to do that , but i want to look like that , in a photo . </s>
photos , where you have to think about a short moment to the trick . </s>
so , it &apos;s more about a idea of a moment , a moment . </s>
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ? </s>
it &apos;s about the detail or the colors of the colors ? </s>
it &apos;s about light ? </s>
how to do illusion ? </s>
sometimes the illusion is going to be . </s>
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface . </s>
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we &apos;re doing for is . </s>
so i think the basics are very simple . </s>
i see them as a puzzle of reality , you can take different pieces of reality and sit to create a alternative reality . </s>
and let me show you a simple example . </s>
we have three of these perfectly physical objects that we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world . </s>
but in a certain way , a certain kind of software can still look at something that is still even more important than if it could exist . </s>
but at the same time we know that it &apos;s possible . </s>
so we &apos;re interested in our brains , because our brains don &apos;t really simply make sense . </s>
and i see the same process in the paper . </s>
it &apos;s just about different realities . </s>
so the things that are realistic , i think , is the things that i don &apos;t think about , the things we don &apos;t think about . </s>
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because you just can &apos;t see them . </s>
so i &apos;d say , there &apos;s three simple rules to obey a <unk> outcome to make a difference outcome . </s>
as you can see , this is not three special pictures . </s>
but can you create something like this . </s>
so the first rule is that the students have been sending the same way of having a pictures . </s>
second , two pictures should have taken the same <unk> . </s>
and these two pictures combined dark , from the same height , and the same <unk> . </s>
third , it &apos;s about making it possible to distinguish , where the individual images can start to make it by creating action . </s>
it &apos;s impossible to say how this photograph has been going to be a little bit . </s>
so you see color and brightness and brightness and brightness images on the edges of the individual <unk> , photographic demos colors , photographic demos colors and <unk> , <unk> colors , <unk> colors and disorders , as a single photo of the <unk> . </s>
here &apos;s another example . </s>
you may think that &apos;s just a basic thing , and the bottom part was . </s>
this picture is actually , but in fact , really completely composed of different places . </s>
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to create a place to find a place that doesn &apos;t find to find out the ideas in his head . </s>
but it requires a lot of planning . </s>
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed to get to a plan to find them to plan to find different places . </s>
for instance , the fish was taken in a <unk> . </s>
the other place from one place . </s>
the <unk> comes from a quarry . </s>
and yes , i even walking the house on the island to look like it &apos;s going to be look like the <unk> . </s>
to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s from me to see planning . </s>
i &apos;m always going to start with a <unk> , one idea . </s>
after that , it goes around the combination of the different images . </s>
and here &apos;s a little bit of a bit very good . </s>
and if you can get good , good , it can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic . </s>
so , it &apos;s all tools , and the only thing that we are , is our imagination . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
i &apos;d like to talk about why so many of why many <unk> are <unk> . </s>
and i think the most important point is that we stopped , with our patients . </s>
and one of the things we &apos;ve been doing was introduced to the <unk> , a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically -- you can &apos;t imagine -- you &apos;re looking at a cup of coffee or tea to the patients , families , say , &quot; how about it ? &quot; </s>
how can we help ? &quot; </s>
and we think we want this to be one of the main problems , why all -- i just want to be the most respected of the electronic <unk> : because we stopped . </s>
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing . </s>
she &apos;s got a button , and it &apos;s a button . </s>
and every morning i &apos;m going to go . </s>
and i have a task , like you may recognize . </s>
i have been rebuilt with 95 . </s>
it &apos;s just simply saying : every time i &apos;m going to be on the side , you &apos;ll send my data to google . </s>
and they &apos;re also going to be able to see from my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is not just the moment in which i support the <unk> , or so , but also , with a look at a time . </s>
there &apos;s something else . </s>
maybe you can see that , i &apos;ve been talking about 4,000 <unk> in twitter . </s>
so every morning i &apos;m on my favorite <unk> and people talk about my <unk> before i &apos;m in the <unk> , i &apos;m sitting in the lunch , &quot; for lunch . &quot; </s>
but that &apos;s what &apos;s the <unk> thing that happen is because this is the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used to obesity , or it could be <unk> . </s>
it could be used to get people out of their bodies , and they tend to make some sort of play some kind of personal health and their health care . </s>
next week , it goes into the market . </s>
it &apos;s going to be that little <unk> that you &apos;re going to be on a iphone or so <unk> . </s>
and it &apos;s going to enable people to measure the home , from the home to measure their doctor and it &apos;s going to send to be able to share with others for something more than 100 dollars . </s>
at this point , you can get the patient into the game . you can &apos;t just control the control over the challenges , and can also be able to get to health care of our own , but we can also be able to help us with the health system , and so on . </s>
do you make the easy to use , and start with this one , patients in the team patients . </s>
and they can do that by these kinds of ways . </s>
and one of the things we did , i &apos;d like to share with you through a quick video . </s>
we all have been trained in our cars . </s>
perhaps even mobile phones . </s>
we know exactly where all the atm atms are around around <unk> . </s>
we know where all of the things are happening . </s>
and we can find <unk> . </s>
but where would be the next generation of <unk> to help this patient ? </s>
we have <unk> , and no one knew it . </s>
nobody knew where the next worldview was to find the next answer to this moment . </s>
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done a <unk> in the netherlands . </s>
we have a website and a <unk> , &quot; if you can see a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , you &apos;re going to share with , &quot; because he &apos;s <unk> closed , of course , &quot; because he &apos;s closed closed . </s>
and over 10,000 years , we &apos;ve been in the netherlands . </s>
the next step was to find it , for that . </s>
and we have a <unk> <unk> . </s>
we have a app for <unk> , extended reality , to find these <unk> . </s>
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , you can see , you can use your iphone and you &apos;re going to use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can save the next quarter of the nearest world . </s>
and then we want to do this as a <unk> , like the product of it , but also as a <unk> . </s>
and we want to get this to a global scale . </s>
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues all over the world , from other universities to help us how to help the <unk> world in order to crowdsource that <unk> across the entire world . </s>
and if you &apos;re in vacation , and somebody else , it &apos;s your own personal or somebody else , you can find a <unk> . </s>
the other thing we want to think is that companies are all over the world at the fossil record . </s>
this might be <unk> , or a technician , just to ensure that the <unk> still <unk> still still hold on its place . </s>
please help us do this , and try to make health , not just to improve it to make health . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
today i &apos;m going to report nuclear discoveries . </s>
i &apos;m working in the <unk> . </s>
and my little <unk> wants to be that we &apos;re forcing to take us to the environment , by studying ... </s>
... it &apos;s the <unk> of the puzzle . </s>
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do . </s>
oh . a moment . </s>
it &apos;s going to be a liar . </s>
now — we can skip the video -- i &apos;m going to just be the video game ... </s>
no . </s>
it &apos;s not going to be ... </s>
okay . </s>
<unk> is ... </s>
oh , my time is over ? </s>
okay . thanks very . </s>
so a few years ago , i have a program that i started a program to come from the driving in technology and design to work a year to work pretty much everything that &apos;s really , we have them in the government . </s>
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> . </s>
we choose some of the fellows we were working with <unk> . </s>
instead of send in the third world , we send them in <unk> . </s>
and developed developed they worked with urban collaborators . </s>
but what they really do is to show the technology today . </s>
so , you can al . </s>
al <unk> in the city is boston . </s>
this is when he looks after a date , but what he really is looking for a date , but what he really is , he &apos;s looking at the him , if he &apos;s <unk> , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when he comes from a meter . </s>
how did he get to look for assistance ? </s>
we had last year from the team in boston , the code for america . </s>
they were there in february , and it has been a lot of february , and it has been a lot more <unk> . </s>
and they realized that the city never had this <unk> . </s>
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , noticed , and that was that the residents that the <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> of the excitement , right . </s>
so he did , what would do good , he wrote a app . </s>
it &apos;s a nice way to get a <unk> in which you can see a tree . </s>
you climb up to <unk> , if it &apos;s natural . </s>
if you do that , you give him a name , and he called the first al <unk> . </s>
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody else is going to take you . </s>
so there &apos;s a nice little video game . </s>
this is a <unk> <unk> . </s>
it probably is probably the smallest 21 of the 21 apps that have been written in the last year . </s>
but they do something that no other <unk> does . </s>
they &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very fast . </s>
there is this guy in the <unk> city of <unk> <unk> , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but it &apos;s the citizen response to the <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but the people are the batteries . </s>
it was a pilot , it was <unk> . </s>
and then finally , seattle to use the citizens to the citizens of the <unk> <unk> . </s>
and chicago , she &apos;s just introduced to people the <unk> , if it &apos;s natural . </s>
we know , nine cities , the planning , to use these app . </s>
and they have moved to , organic , of course . </s>
if you know something about the <unk> , you know , it doesn &apos;t normally so . </s>
the most promising of the software is a few years . </s>
we had a team of that last year in boston , for the three people forcibly just took the three people . </s>
it was a way of seeing parents with the parents that can find the most public public school . </s>
we were told that if it was going to go over the normal and the normal part , it would have been taken over two years and it would have been a million dollars . </s>
and that &apos;s not a thing . </s>
there are a project in the california , which has lasted two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
and there are projects like this on every plane of the government . </s>
so a app that was written in a few days , and then from <unk> , it &apos;s a way to have a kind of <unk> to the institution of the government . </s>
they think about how the government could work better -- not more like a personal business , how many people think they should . </s>
and not even as a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself . </s>
and that means free access to the open and productive . </s>
and that &apos;s important . </s>
but more importantly , they &apos;re a new generation of their government that &apos;s the problem of the government -- not as the problem of an institution , but as a problem of collective settlement . </s>
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very well in the collective action . </s>
now there &apos;s a great community of people who make the tools that we need to do things differently . </s>
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , there are hundreds of people in all the country who are getting up in the country and <unk> , every day in their own communities . </s>
they didn &apos;t want the government . </s>
they &apos;re not frustrated with her , but they complain about it , they fix them . </s>
and these guys know something we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes . </s>
and that &apos;s when you all feelings about politics and the snake in the front of the other things that we really think about , &quot; what we do is , &quot; what we do in common with the <unk> , &quot; what we do in common with the other words . &quot; </s>
today , a lot of people have the government . </s>
and when you &apos;re , one of these people are , i &apos;m you talking you about it , because the things that change . </s>
politics changes not ; the government is in change . </s>
and because the government is their force from us -- <unk> you -- <unk> you : &quot; we do that people ? &quot; -- how to think about how this change is happening . </s>
i didn &apos;t know much about the government when i started this program . </s>
and how many people , i thought that there was a lot of government &apos;s people in a foreign office . </s>
now , after two years , i &apos;ve got to come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in the local community . </s>
this is the <unk> for service . </s>
you normally have a blind if you <unk> in your city . </s>
if you ever get the chance to work in your cubicle , how our fellow acts as our understanding of our fellow acts as part of the program -- in fact , the people who are doing many different problems , including a <unk> in your house . </s>
scott so scott , so scott . </s>
he &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database . </s>
and he &apos;s not really a clue . he &apos;s beginning to be catching up with the <unk> . </s>
and finally he says , &quot; look , you can just open up all the doors in your home and very <unk> music and see if the livestock is ? &quot; </s>
and it worked . </s>
but that was not the end of the <unk> . </s>
boston is not just a change . </s>
it has a app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
we didn &apos;t even wrote that . </s>
this is the work very smart people in the office of new zealand . </s>
one day -- this is a <unk> report -- came in my <unk> , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s dead . </s>
how do i get to see them ? &quot; </s>
but what happens to &quot; <unk> &quot; is different . </s>
scott of human being human human . </s>
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is anything like anyone can see it . </s>
and in this case , it saw a neighbor . </s>
and the next one is , &quot; i went there , &quot; i went there to the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . </s>
<unk> ? yes . alive . </s>
turned out to the page . </s>
good night , &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
quite simple . </s>
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital thing . </s>
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the fashion industry . </s>
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government . </s>
and i &apos;m not necessarily a technological definition of the platform . </s>
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves other people and others . </s>
a citizen helped you citizen , but the government was here a central role . </s>
they have to do these two people . </s>
and you &apos;d have to connect them to the government if they were going to be a better , but a neighbor is a far better and more advanced <unk> . </s>
if a neighbor of the other community , we are looking at our communities . </s>
so , we call it a lot of money . </s>
one of the most important things that we have to think is that the government is not the same as politics . </s>
and most people understand that , but they believe that one was the input of the other . </s>
that our contributions to the vote is . </s>
how often do we take a political leader -- and sometimes we expect a lot of energy to choose a new political leader to choose a new political leader to choose a new political leader , and then we reject that the government , and then hasn &apos;t changed ? </s>
that &apos;s because the government is a red ocean and politics that are the <unk> <unk> . </s>
and what is it is that we call bureaucracy . </s>
and we use this word with such input . </s>
but it is this contempt that we have to pay and we &apos;re paying for the idea of something we &apos;re working on , that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves . </s>
people seem sexy . </s>
if we want to work that we have to work , we need to make bureaucracy , we &apos;ve got to make bureaucracy . </s>
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is occurring . </s>
we need to be able to go to the machinery of the government . </s>
so the <unk> has done . </s>
you saw this guys ? </s>
it &apos;s a group of <unk> who wrote a very detailed ball report that wrote a very detailed ball of <unk> <unk> . </s>
this is not being active is being active . </s>
now , for those of us who have the government , it &apos;s time to think about the world that we want to think about the world that we want to our children . </s>
you have to think you &apos;re challenges , you have to have to imagine . </s>
do we really need to do that we have to do that without a institution that we have to make a institution that &apos;s happening in the name of us all ? </s>
one is absolutely necessary to be absolutely , but the need to become more efficient . </s>
the good news is that technology is possible to function the function of the government profoundly <unk> in a way that actually can achieve the society . </s>
and there &apos;s a generation of a generation that &apos;s <unk> internet , and that &apos;s not that hard to do things that is so hard to do that for the right systems . </s>
now , the average of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m an <unk> generation of being a generation of you . </s>
this is a generation that &apos;s been talking to the first thing that &apos;s going to be a vote . </s>
they &apos;re fighting to this battle , which we all fight , about who you can do , that you can all talk about who else &apos;s . </s>
you can take your mind to every channel , and you can do it . </s>
so if you multiply with the problem of government , you &apos;re not so much about your voices . </s>
they use their hands . </s>
they use their hands to write applications that the government improves . </s>
and these apps , let us take our communities to improve our communities . </s>
it could be , a <unk> <unk> , a trash with a <unk> <unk> . </s>
and certainly , we have this <unk> all over time , and many people do that . </s>
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers are not only paying attention and the energy that receive control . </s>
we are citizens , we are citizens . </s>
and we &apos;re going to improve the government , until we make the citizenship . </s>
so the question i &apos;ve all heard about this : when it comes to you , when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or we will be a lot of the hands of hands ? </s>
thank you . </s>
normally , my role is to explain to explain , how wonderful are the wonderful technologies that are the best technologies , which is , and i &apos;m here under friends i &apos;d be , and i &apos;m here under friends i &apos;d like to make this . and also try to understand what &apos;s going on with these incredible <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m going to show you a single story , boring <unk> . </s>
... you can show the slide . </s>
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen to happen to my professional . </s>
it &apos;s not about the detail of the slide , but rather in the general form of the general shape . </s>
this slide shows data from a analysis of us about the performance of a <unk> music . </s>
the interesting thing here is that this slide , how do we get this , like this , which is often different in our field , a kind of a little <unk> curve . </s>
other words : every one step here is equivalent to the <unk> . </s>
and this is a consequence that we have this guy &apos;s called the <unk> curves in the field of energy . </s>
something very simple happens . </s>
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about . </s>
so , if you could get the lights on the screen . </s>
still something else because i &apos;m going to go to the paper here . </s>
now , why we &apos;re talking about that technology , we have curves in the technology ? </s>
the reason for this is when i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the <unk> , so we &apos;re looking at the <unk> , which is the one that i want to share with a graph is ridiculous . </s>
the way that you look like . </s>
and that tells us not much . </s>
if i want to leave a different technology , let &apos;s say , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in a flat line . </s>
but if something like this is what happens to happen , that &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
so if the <unk> as fast as the <unk> would be like the <unk> , we could be able to get <unk> into a taxi store and 30 seconds . </s>
but that &apos;s not what fast is happening . </s>
there was never before in history , and that kind of growth in history , in the way that the price of <unk> growth , which is the economy for the few years . </s>
now the question i &apos;d like to share with you now is when you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s not going to go forever . </s>
it &apos;s not possible that all of us and forever and forever forever quickly as now . </s>
there are two ways of : there &apos;s two ways . </s>
either will be able to make a classical <unk> like this , until something really , like here , or it &apos;s going to happen . </s>
that &apos;s about . </s>
well , i think , i think , i think something like this is going to happen here . </s>
is that really , then we mean here in the moment in the moment in the moment in a transition . </s>
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world , a new way of world . </s>
so the question i want to do , and i often ask ourselves , and i often ask ourselves , &quot; how do this new world will be ? </s>
what is new state that &apos;s going to be the world &apos;s opinion ? </s>
because the transition seems to be very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it . </s>
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people talked about what would happen to what would happen to be in 2000 . </s>
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future still has been 2000 in 2000 . </s>
we don &apos;t go to the end . </s>
so in other words , the future every year i &apos;m on this world . </s>
i think the reason we &apos;re finding that is that there is something in the most remote . </s>
the transition is going to feel like this . </s>
and we know that it &apos;s simply not a sense of doing a sense of whether or 50 years to look at the future , because everything is so different that a simple marketing is top-down out of what we &apos;re doing now . </s>
so i want to talk about what that transition is where we are at the moment . </s>
and to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t really have been using technology to the computer . </s>
because i think i think this really can be understood , we need to go back to a <unk> and we look at a <unk> <unk> . </s>
and i want to look at this on the most <unk> of life of the earth . </s>
i think that &apos;s the most frightening thing that &apos;s going to sense when you &apos;re in some <unk> . </s>
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s a <unk> years , and the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with many of these <unk> chemicals . </s>
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized like this , we have a pretty good picture of how they <unk> the <unk> . </s>
i think there are theories that start with understanding how everything has started to understand that that &apos;s why we have a conference story about what that time little <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which different kinds of <unk> programs for chemicals . </s>
some of these <unk> <unk> are a special combination of chemicals from chemicals and so on , it &apos;s going to take other chemicals of the chemicals and so forth . </s>
everybody started getting up . </s>
these little <unk> were in the senses of <unk> . </s>
but they were not <unk> , about a marine life in the world because each one of them was just a little , <unk> recipe from chemicals . </s>
and every time it &apos;s been evolving , they spread the <unk> chemicals . </s>
so each <unk> is a little different . </s>
in fact , the <unk> that had a <unk> for growth and growing up more growth than others and more chemicals from the outside and shared and faster . </s>
so these are the longer , longer to survive and she fell in <unk> . </s>
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interestingly , it &apos;s a simple trick when this <unk> had a trick . </s>
in fact , in a way , which is not quite understanding , this <unk> capacity , the ability to learn information to information . </s>
they learned the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical shape that we call dna . </s>
in other words , you have a <unk> , and a way of all you have to do that allowed them to be the <unk> , so that they could be able to get that that information and copied them . </s>
the amazing thing about the time of 2.5 billion years , in which she is , in the suburbs , in which she was released , is the same thing . </s>
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same . </s>
and that &apos;s where every living organism , the exact same letters and the same code . </s>
we &apos;re at the way we can write , just in that code , the thing can be . </s>
and i have 100 <unk> of a <unk> that i &apos;m going to talk about in airports from <unk> . </s>
and in fact , what i &apos;ve done -- what i did is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code letters that we use to use the <unk> -- the code letters that we use to use the <unk> dna . </s>
so if somebody &apos;s a hundred billion copies of my <unk> , i have ample enough for everyone in this room and even in the world , and it &apos;s right here . </s>
if i was a <unk> , <unk> , i would have to get them on a virus and in the room . </s>
so what &apos;s next to do ? </s>
the dna of dna was a interesting thing . </s>
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years . </s>
but then another , very interesting step , where things have been completely different , and that &apos;s how the things that have been able to communicate , so that communities have been able to communicate from cells . </s>
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually be able to share their dna . </s>
and that &apos;s why the data grows to antibiotics . </s>
some bacteria have figured out how they can distinguish on penicillin of the other people and have this information together with other bacteria in dna , which demands we have a lot of bacteria , which demands the bacteria . </s>
this communications indicates the same thing in a certain sense of the same boat , they were <unk> , they were <unk> . </s>
so they either <unk> , or they walked together under the microscope , all the individuals are the individuals of the community and the evolution of the community and evolution and evolution of evolution . </s>
the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to where these communities are the driving community into a <unk> dna . </s>
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years . </s>
at this point , we have <unk> communities , communities from many <unk> <unk> , which are <unk> as a <unk> organism , which is as a <unk> organism . </s>
in fact , we are also doing a <unk> community . </s>
we have a lot of cells that are not alone in itself alone . </s>
you &apos;re useless without heart disease , muscle , intellectual and so on . </s>
so these communities started so that the layer of evolution , which is evolution , in which case the evolution of evolution , not the single cell longer that we call organism . </s>
the next step of the day is now in this communities . </s>
the <unk> started to have information to the world . </s>
and they developed certain kinds of structures that were made of doing nothing in the organism . </s>
and these are the neural structures . </s>
so the neurons are the <unk> that they built these <unk> . </s>
they started interested in specialists in specialists , specifically structures , which is responsible for learning to learn , understanding the information . </s>
and this was the brain and the nervous system . </s>
this gave you a very humble advantage . </s>
because at that point -- learning that an individual is now within the period of one single organism , rather than a single organism , rather than a <unk> period of this organism . </s>
so a organism was learning to learn to eat a certain <unk> , because they were bad , and they made him sick , the last time he was eating . </s>
so this could happen within a single organism , whereas virtually hundreds of years , whereas that happened to be used by the individuals , because they learned to the individuals , which is the <unk> that they died of this , because they were not yet they were yet . </s>
so , nervous system has been nervous by the <unk> of this particular <unk> because evolution could occur in a single individual . </s>
it could take place . </s>
what happened after that individual organisms has been able to communicate with each other . </s>
let &apos;s see the <unk> of us in the <unk> of this pollutant is the human language . </s>
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it . </s>
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> in my head . </s>
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically going to give the same with the <unk> of me in the hopes of the person in the head that have a certain amount of mine , which has a certain amount of mine . </s>
so we take a little bit of a complicated , a <unk> of sound , and make it a little bit of a little bit of a complicated thing in the heads of others . </s>
so this allows organism to work as a unified organism . </s>
and what we actually did in human beings started to have the <unk> , we started to have a <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ve been working with the same levels of which <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods , how we &apos;re going to be able to grow up . </s>
the invention of speech was a little step in this direction . </s>
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on , our greatest selves that we built in our community to have this information . </s>
and it connects us all together to something much bigger , and also is able to build faster faster than we were . </s>
so , today , so , can we have evolution in the area of microseconds . </s>
you also see , you know , <unk> little <unk> where he saw a little bit of evolution in the &quot; <unk> &quot; program right now . </s>
so now we have the <unk> again . </s>
the first steps of history i &apos;ve been told you about , <unk> a billion years a piece of play . </s>
the next steps , how the nervous system and the brain , <unk> some hundreds of millions years . </s>
then the <unk> steps , as language and so on , <unk> less than a million years . </s>
and this next steps , as electronics , seem to take a few decades . </s>
and the process is going to be the itself , and it &apos;s going to be so , i think , is the word for this -- if something does his <unk> <unk> . </s>
the more it changes it . </s>
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve . </s>
we see the process that &apos;s been evolving by itself . </s>
i live , in a half , from computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use to build computer games , not using the previous economy in the store . </s>
my current activity is in a high complexity of finding that it &apos;s impossible to design complexity for me that it is impossible to design this in traditional sense . </s>
i don &apos;t know what any one transistor in the <unk> is doing . </s>
it has billions of those things . </s>
what i instead instead , and what also the designers do we make it , we think we &apos;re thinking about a certain level , and the machine makes something that our skills are far more useful to us , better and faster than we ever could do . </s>
and they do it partially partly we don &apos;t even understand . </s>
a way that &apos;s particularly interesting , which is particularly interesting , and which i often used to be used in a lot of time . </s>
and we put a <unk> in the machine , which is in <unk> . </s>
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that &apos;s made of the closest environment . </s>
we say , &quot; computers , please give a hundred million of <unk> for the <unk> of . </s>
now , we &apos;re all going to take all of these randomly generators , and then , all of the programs , and the ones that are ultimately ultimately ultimately , and then finally , the one of my relatives are on the next . &quot; </s>
so in other words , i think i want to first . </s>
let &apos;s say , i want to show you about the simple example that i &apos;ve been using for that . </s>
so , that &apos;s the closest of the most elementary numbers can . </s>
of course , chances is very small , very small , very small , that it &apos;s been shown by chance , by chance , is not actually the effect . </s>
but one of which likes to have something about something that &apos;s very lucky to the right order . </s>
now i say , &quot; computer , take the 10 percent of the sequences that have been coming in the next , which are my closest growth . </s>
and this is the rest of the rest . </s>
now all of these <unk> who have the numbers of numbers of the best . </s>
and this is a method of the <unk> , analog to the reproduction . &quot; </s>
take two programs , they produce children through the <unk> , and the kids are <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the two programs . </s>
so now i have a new generation of programs that were driven by combinations of programs that have a little closer to the structure . </s>
not &quot; well , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot; </s>
she &apos;s again . </s>
maybe some of the mutations . </s>
and try to another generation . </s>
of all kinds of insights , just enjoying this generations . </s>
and so i can undergo a evolution over millions of years in the computer in a less time , or in a <unk> cases . </s>
i finally , i have programs that can be perfect . </s>
in fact , this programs are so much more efficient than any program that i could have ever done . </s>
if i put this kind of programs , i can &apos;t tell you how to do . </s>
i tried to understand them . </s>
they &apos;re driven and strange programs . </s>
but she &apos;s doing job . </s>
i know , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve got the job because they come from a number of <unk> programs that have job . </s>
because you &apos;ve got a job right away , whether you &apos;re going to get the job right . </s>
i sat in a 747 with marvin , <unk> , he &apos;s a map of a map , and he says , &quot; oh , look . check out . look at you . look at you . look at you . look at you . look at you . look at you . look at you . look at you . look at you . look at you .
there &apos;s a plane , &quot; from <unk> <unk> , which are working together to make their flight of doing safe . &quot; </s>
we know that a <unk> is not a clean when he &apos;s too complicated . </s>
so let &apos;s start to rely on the computer , for a process that &apos;s going to be the classical regions . </s>
it allows us to make things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal way of producing the normal methods . </s>
and yet , however , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibilities . </s>
so <unk> technology is the technology . </s>
so we &apos;re using this programs to make the computer more quickly , so that we can be able to do that , these processes can be able to do that . </s>
so it &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing . </s>
because all of these new technologies are going to feed themselves . </s>
we raise the way . </s>
we &apos;re at a point of finding , which is to be <unk> as a <unk> . </s>
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite get quite close to what we are actually here in the same way . </s>
we are in this <unk> . </s>
but i really believe that &apos;s a bit of us . </s>
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we &apos;re the greatest impact . </s>
and i think we are all here in the creation of the creation . </s>
now , the lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear this , before i &apos;m going to get more <unk> . </s>
my story begins here in a two years ago , about two years ago . </s>
i was under the <unk> in the desert in the desert of <unk> <unk> . </s>
we talked about it since the time of ancient indian indian national <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
if we wanted to travel at the travel time , we put in a car and <unk> across the sky . </s>
now we &apos;re going to have airplanes . </s>
back then , as the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , <unk> , <unk> in the soil and water . </s>
now we do that with <unk> and machines . </s>
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic of machines were replaced by machines . </s>
i really made me . </s>
i was a little freaked . </s>
it was afraid i could have been able to get the ability to be able to enjoy the ability to be able to get the ability and without my friends . </s>
i found that technology should be able to do that technology should not kill and kill . </s>
when i was a little girl , my grandfather was <unk> his little <unk> <unk> . </s>
this piece of 50 years is called the <unk> thing for me . </s>
she became a world access to a world full of pirates and <unk> in my imagination . </s>
i came to the way our send us clocks and cameras to the pier . </s>
they were inspired by being able to become inspired . </s>
and so i went to the world of technology to kill them to kill them to kill rather than that . </s>
and i started to illustrate books . </s>
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling that readers all of the world . </s>
it can be . </s>
we &apos;re going to know where we are . </s>
it &apos;s the <unk> images and text and <unk> , and touch . </s>
the storytelling is always senses . </s>
but what do we do with this ? </s>
i &apos;m just going to <unk> a break , a interactive book . </s>
this is , &quot; on every light on every light . &quot; </s>
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box ... &quot; there &apos;s a little ... &quot; </s>
and i &apos;ll be a character in the book . </s>
and again , it goes back a letter to me , and the ipad i know about gps , and the ipad i know -- that &apos;s really about me . </s>
the kid in me is really thrilled . </s>
i &apos;ve talked about magic . </s>
i don &apos;t mean , my <unk> and dragons of childhood , the ideas that we all had to be , as children who had all been children . </s>
if i found very , i was very exciting . </s>
so you have to go down here and the fireflies are <unk> . </s>
and the <unk> is through the internet . </s>
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single <unk> . </s>
and so every world book is this little <unk> that i come to come to the magical device , which i &apos;m going to come to the magical device . </s>
and this is opening up . </s>
but <unk> had always maps , but these cards were static . </s>
this map grows and glows and <unk> and <unk> in the rest of the book . </s>
they also show up to other places of the book . </s>
i &apos;m going to go in . </s>
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is also very <unk> . </s>
this is the <unk> . </s>
we all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people who are talking about india who are <unk> ? </s>
the poor <unk> were thousands of years into <unk> , in a old book , in a old book . </s>
and we bring them back to a contemporary story . </s>
one story that &apos;s been messing with new issues like the chagos archipelago . </s>
to have a big deal , a big problem of the last 10 years that children in their rooms , they sit on their computers . </s>
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world . </s>
in a interaction of a interaction of the book , you have to come up with the camera of the vastness and with the camera of the vastness of imagery . </s>
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . </s>
somehow , no more . </s>
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go to a chapter of a flower and tag . </s>
in another chapter , you have to get a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag . </s>
so you actually have a digital collection of photos that you can then put on . </s>
a kid in london , the picture of a football and says , &quot; oh , i have a commitment . &quot; </s>
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot; </s>
this is a kind of social network about digital collection of photos that actually has taken up . </s>
there are a variety of opportunities in understanding the world and technology . </s>
in the next part of the book we &apos;re planning to the video of the brain and the <unk> , a animation of <unk> , who &apos;s going to see on a plant . </s>
on one spot , the screen with the leaves . </s>
you have to read the sound of the <unk> , and it &apos;s the rest of the sea reading . </s>
we all move around a world where the building remains of technology come and in the magic and technology can be able to become a better world . </s>
we use energy from the sun . </s>
we take our kids and we &apos;re closer to the natural world and to the natural world of our childhood , and the love of our childhood medium is simple . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
this is really a extraordinary privilege to me . </s>
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
i spend most of my time with the social <unk> in the <unk> and places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness . </s>
here &apos;s ted to be ted , and i &apos;m hearing , like , &quot; look , &quot; it has a lot of strength . </s>
in the short time , i was told to see a clear : ted has been a identity . </s>
you can tell things that are influence . </s>
and sometimes when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and force that it wouldn &apos;t have been . </s>
i say that identity is very important . </s>
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations . </s>
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a meaning is a very important thing , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated . </s>
as a doctor , you can do good , but when a <unk> doctor can be done . </s>
and so i want to talk about the power of identity . </s>
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer . </s>
i learned that from my grandmother . </s>
i was big in a family , a traditional <unk> household who household by a <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s a <unk> , my grandmother was my grandmother . </s>
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had a little . </s>
she had the last word in every <unk> . </s>
she was also the starting to get in our family . </s>
she was the daughter of a <unk> . </s>
her parents were born in virginia when slaves . </s>
she was born by the west and the experience of slavery has been very strong . </s>
my grandmother was strong , but she was also a typical . </s>
if i met you as a little boy , she came to me and <unk> me . </s>
she was so stuck with me that i could barely breathe , and then she got me . </s>
one or two hours later , when i met her , and she was , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , i feel like you still have my name ? &quot; </s>
and if i was going to be &quot; no , &quot; she said , &quot; if i was going to be &quot; yes , &quot; she said , she turned me to . </s>
and you were something that was going to be near that you wanted to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
the only problem was that they had to have children . </s>
my mom was the youngest of her children . </s>
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was difficult to acquire your attention . </s>
my cousins was around everywhere . </s>
i remember i have to be eight or nine , i woke up one morning , i went to the morning . </s>
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and i was on . </s>
first of all , i thought that was a game . </s>
i looked at them and <unk> , but they saw a very serious . </s>
this was like this 15 minutes . and then she stood up to me , and then she took me at the hand , and she took me , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i &apos;m going to talk . &quot; </s>
i remember it was more . </s>
i &apos;ll never forget it . </s>
she took me to outside the outside and i said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to tell you that you don &apos;t <unk> . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; well , grandma . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
she sat down me and looked at me , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot; </s>

we &apos;re constantly adjusting . </s>
we create new tensions and conflict . </s>
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that we are not going to be willing to be not , understanding the process of truth and reconciliation . </s>

we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see . </s>
we do that . so we &apos;re also rational , so we &apos;re also rational . </s>
innovation , and development , don &apos;t just come from our heads . </s>

there are no more recent hardware to technology and design that it allows us to be human , unless we &apos;re not going to be the eyes and ears , and injustice , and injustice . </s>

i don &apos;t think that . </s>
i think that &apos;s too many places that the opposite of poverty is to the opposite justice . </s>
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , we &apos;re not at the end of our technology , not to the things we &apos;re developing , not at the end of our intellect , not to our intellect and understood . </s>
it &apos;s not going to be measured by itself , how they create their rich and powerful , and powerful , but how they interacted with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> . </s>
because in this context , we start to understand the incredible thing that we &apos;re going to do . </s>
sometimes i balance the balance . </s>

i &apos;ve got to come back to ted because i think many of you have understood that many of you have understood the moral career , but it &apos;s the justice of the justice system . </s>
we &apos;re not designed to be completely evolving as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> . </s>
every single thing that we &apos;re doing in the survival is to have the same thing . </s>
we &apos;ve created our visions of technology and design and creativity , and creativity , and creativity , and justice . </s>
and most of all , i want to share with you that the way i &apos;m just seeing this , just lose your goal , not you lose your goal out . </s>
you &apos;d have to go on this audience and that community , and they &apos;re hearing to help them and do something . </s>
what can we do ? </s>

if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s about to be a <unk> that &apos;s about to be a more effort , something of the <unk> , which is the politics of punishment . </s>
so here &apos;s in california , for example , you will get a billion dollars for the death rate for the death penalty billion . </s>
and yet , 46 percent of all the <unk> are not going to be <unk> with a <unk> . </s>
but they didn &apos;t get clean up trial . </s>
there &apos;s the chance to do something . </s>
this is bringing up the money that money in more security and security . </s>
i think there are ways of possibilities . </s>
during the last three decades , the most <unk> jobs in america are <unk> . </s>
this is actually a relationship with the elevated <unk> . </s>
what would you say to someone &apos;s going to be ? </s>

now we have a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , which people are getting behind bars of bars for the theft , rather than the theft , rather than the theft that you &apos;re forcing them to sacrifice . </s>
i think we need to do more to help people that have been a <unk> <unk> . </s>

so that &apos;s just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve been collected about the last six months -- but it had the last six days , or the last six years . </s>
in fact , the media is able to prefer to show us negative themes , because our minds are happening to this topics . </s>
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for it . </s>
every second day , our senses has much more information than our brain , as our brain activity can ever chew information . </s>
and because of it more important than our survival , the first one is a bit of our information that &apos;s been the amygdala of our <unk> . </s>
the amygdala is our <unk> . </s>
it was done by the whole information , looking for the most <unk> information of our environment in our environment . </s>
so if we see the news , we prefer to be able to look for negative news . </s>
and the old adage &quot; when it &apos;s <unk> , &quot; is very true . </s>
now , with all our digital devices that we &apos;ve been seven days ago , 24 hours of the day all this negative news , is not a miracle that we are . </s>
it &apos;s not a miracle that is always about the world &apos;s world . </s>
but possibly not that the case . </s>
maybe you might be able to see . </s>
maybe we &apos;ve made huge huge tremendous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century , so strong that we &apos;ve made us into the next three decades , a world of abundance . </s>
well , i &apos;m saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> -- we have the world &apos;s already going to have . </s>
and as humans , we are much better in it , problems in very long ways , but they finally have to overcome . </s>
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , we can see the evolution of the evolution . </s>
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled that inflation has tripled , the inflation of the world &apos;s population has tripled . </s>
child mortality has been a tenth . </s>

this is <unk> innovation . </s>
and we &apos;ve seen this in a way . </s>
you mean my goodness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent of the mobile <unk> of mobile phones in developing countries . </s>
just think that a <unk> in the middle of kenya was a cell phone in the middle kenya , a <unk> <unk> . </s>
and if you &apos;re looking at your smartphone on google , they have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton about 15 years ago . </s>
they live in a world that information and communications is that nobody could have been able to predict how it ever could predict . </s>
and it &apos;s better to do that , and i &apos;m a lot of thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries and photo , libraries , technology and <unk> , technology , technology and <unk> , technology is literally <unk> and cheaper . </s>
and the best part of us is to be <unk> . </s>
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the <unk> &apos; &quot; $ 10,000 million x <unk> x prize . &quot; </s>
we &apos;re starting to connect in the whole world , all these technologies are connected to each other , because you can aggregate with ai , because it &apos;s going to talk to the device or your <unk> . </s>
and to extract , this is a better diagnosis of a better diagnosis of a team . </s>
imagine this device in a developing country where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the health and 1.3 percent of the health and 1.3 percent of the health of health . </s>
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> , who is known to the heart , it &apos;s not known to the heart and <unk> a pandemic . </s>
but now , the power of us will lead to a world of the value . </s>
i call them &quot; the &quot; <unk> billion . &quot; </s>
the whites lines are in favor . </s>
we just have the <unk> <unk> . </s>
and only by the way , the biggest <unk> against one is a better upbringing and diet in the entire world . </s>
in 2010 , we had to have two billion people in each other . </s>
by 2020 , we &apos;ll <unk> from two billion <unk> . </s>
three billion new minds that we never heard before , will join the global communication . </s>
what &apos;s needed to do ? </s>
what are you consume ? what are you going to do ? </s>
and instead of looking at a <unk> , i see a great economic economic economic value of history . </s>
these people are getting hundreds of dollars that will be able to flow out into the global economy . </s>
and they &apos;re going to be using the use of the <unk> healthier , and they &apos;re going to be able to use better and so trained through the <unk> , and so much more productive , 3d printers , 3d printers , and so much more productive than ever before . </s>
so what can be three billion growing , healthy , productive members of <unk> us ? </s>
what about a sentence , never <unk> . </s>
how about it that is the oppressed , where they are , a voice to make a voice to make it look at the time and change , for the first time , for the first time ? </s>
what are these three billion people ? </s>
how about <unk> we can &apos;t predict ? </s>
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that small teams that are small teams and focus motivated and focus in creating extraordinary things , things that have great businesses , and governments only could have done . </s>
i want to conclude with a story that has really been really excited . </s>
there &apos;s a program that some may have been before . </s>
it &apos;s a game called the user interface . </s>
it was <unk> in seattle . </s>
and it &apos;s a game to the individuals where people can take a sequence of exploring the protein , how to evolve that protein is developing . </s>
the way we can see , we can predict the structure and function . </s>
and this is very important in the <unk> . </s>
so , what happened was a problem for supercomputers . </s>
and this game became played by the time . </s>
and it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online . </s>
and it showed that today , the human <unk> are actually better than the best of the best . </s>
and when these people came and looked at who the best <unk> of the world is not a <unk> , not a woman who was crying in a <unk> operation , not a woman who was <unk> in a <unk> operation and night , and he was the best <unk> of the world . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , what i trust trust is that we have more power than individuals , the fact that we have individuals today is more than individuals to make us challenges of our planet . </s>
we have access to tools with the exponential technology . </s>
we have the passion of a <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ve got the capital capital . </s>
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to work new challenges to master challenges and to do that . </s>
we just expect a couple of extraordinary decades . </s>
thank you . </s>
i think we need something to have a <unk> device for medical businesses . </s>
and i think it &apos;s starting to start with a medical records and the bin . </s>
and maybe i am a long enough in store when i &apos;m going to allow it to myself , and maybe i can take it a piece of my own wrong . </s>
and before i come to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball . </s>
hey , why not ? </s>
we &apos;re moving to the wooden <unk> and move forward . </s>
we all love to baseball , right ? </s>
baseball is full of great statistics . </s>
and there are hundreds of them . </s>
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems to be a soon and a great deal of baseball and a great deal . </s>
i &apos;m going to hope to give me a statistics that most of you already have heard about . </s>
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat &apos;s <unk> . </s>
that means that the player &apos;s going to be a number of 10 thousand dollars . </s>
this is the ball of <unk> , he comes up , he &apos;s not going to be able to throw , he &apos;s not been able to throw the ball , it was not just the recovery and the recovery was in safety . </s>
10th 10th of 10 grains of 10 . </s>
you know how to <unk> a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> ? </s>
well , really good , maybe a <unk> . </s>
you know how to call a <unk> ? </s>
this is somebody else &apos;s been left in the english of four . </s>
<unk> -- like ted williams -- like ted williams -- the last <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
so let &apos;s back in my world in my world of medicine , i may feel about a lot less than i feel with you about it , maybe i talked to you about that . </s>
so , they are a <unk> and you &apos;re going to be able to get to a <unk> sense of <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
does not work , or ? </s>
imagine in a particular neighborhood , and they have a <unk> people with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that led to a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> at 200 . </s>
but , you know what ? </s>
she &apos;s much better . it &apos;s on the top . </s>
and they were a <unk> . </s>
it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question . </s>
what do you think about the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> . </s>
<unk> , very good . </s>
the truth is that nobody is in the whole medicine , which is a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor or a <unk> . </s>
and what we do is we do every one of you , including me , including the world with the one perfect . </s>
never never do a mistake , but no one does the details of how this is going to be done . </s>
and that &apos;s the message that i &apos;m going to do . </s>
i was a complete <unk> student . </s>
in high school , a <unk> told for a <unk> learning to a <unk> learning . </s>
and so it was . </s>
and i learned in my little <unk> in the middle of the <unk> <unk> hospital , <unk> of here . </s>
i learned everything . </s>
in my mind , i learned the origins and release each other , every one of the aorta of <unk> <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> . </s>
i knew even the <unk> <unk> to classify <unk> . </s>
and the most amazing thing i had was more and more knowledge . </s>
and i was good , i was <unk> with <unk> <unk> . </s>
and i left the same thing with the impression i was in case everything , and everything was like possible , so close to the <unk> , so close to the <unk> , i was able to share that . </s>
and it was very much for a time , i met a printer . </s>
i <unk> from a <unk> in toronto , as a woman printer to me , was brought to my <unk> . </s>
at that point i was the <unk> <unk> in the service service . </s>
and it was my first commission as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> advice . </s>
and the <unk> is to give my <unk> . </s>
i studied a printers and she was in <unk> . </s>
and when i was her graduate student sounds , it &apos;s <unk> sounds . </s>
and when i was offered her breasts with the <unk> <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which i told you that they were under <unk> heart failure . </s>
this is a state in the heart of the heart , instead of the entire blood system , and the whole blood flow , it came up with the lens and the <unk> , that came out of the <unk> . </s>
and that was no heavy <unk> diagnosis . </s>
i got to wipe up , and i made me to the treatment . </s>
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the <unk> of the heart . </s>
i gave her medicine , which we call <unk> water , so they &apos;re the liquid <unk> . </s>
and over a five- to two hours , they started to feel better . </s>
i felt good . </s>
and i was a first mistake , i sent her home . </s>
i actually made two mistakes . </s>
i sent her home with my favorite <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m not allowed to know the &apos; interesting thing i &apos;d been trying to do what a call to my <unk> , so that he &apos;d been a chance to make a difference in a sense of image . </s>
and he knew , he &apos;d be able to have additional information information . </s>
maybe good reason i do it . </s>
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a doctor doctor . </s>
and i want to be able to succeed and so i was able to take a responsibility for my patients that i was being told , to anxiety to anxiety without him . </s>
my second mistakes was worse . </s>
so , i sent you home , i sent home , i <unk> a quiet voice in my attempted to say , &quot; <unk> , no good idea . &quot; </s>
in a really convincing , i really think that &apos;s the nurse that i tweeted the nurse that i tweeted the way of the woman , &quot; believe it &apos;s okay ? &quot; </s>
and the nurse thought about it , and i said in <unk> , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot; </s>
i remember it was yesterday . </s>
so i <unk> the <unk> and a <unk> and <unk> and brought them home . </s>
and i went back to work . </s>
the rest of the night i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach . </s>
but i worked on . </s>
and at the end of the day i grabbed my stuff , the hospital and went to the car to try to be home when i was driving to something that i did not . </s>
i went through my way home . </s>
and she was saying a different nurse , not the sister who had seen -- but one of the three words i saw , but one of these words words , most people i know . </s>
other doctors are looking at the nanoscale , but the <unk> is particularly because we see the patients just like this . </s>
the three words : remember , you know ? </s>
&quot; remember the patients ? &quot; </s>
i asked the nurse . </s>
so , &quot; she &apos;s back in this particular <unk> . &quot; </s>
so she was back . </s>
she was back and forth . </s>
about a hour after you were waiting to go home and i was having the <unk> <unk> , she had to go home and the family <unk> , she brought back to a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous game . </s>
she didn &apos;t walk and was blue <unk> . </s>
the <unk> <unk> all the strands . </s>
they gave her <unk> . </s>
they pick it up . </s>
i was shocked and to the insides of the interior . </s>
and i was very <unk> , because she came to the <unk> and i hoped that she would recover . </s>
and after two , three days , she never would be able to get the awakening . </s>
she had a <unk> <unk> . </s>
your family &apos;s going to be . </s>
and in the next eight or nine days , they <unk> . </s>
and on the day they were walking around the day -- wife a woman , a woman , a mom and grandmother . </s>
you say you &apos;re never going to never meet the name of the <unk> . </s>
and that was the first time i learned this myself . </s>
the next month i made myself , and i got a lot of the time the most unhealthy of the most unhealthy culture -- i was alone , &quot; not the kind of <unk> that i was alone , not the way you &apos;re talking about it because you can &apos;t talk to the talk about it . </s>
you know , all the economic shame , if you &apos;re a secret of the best friend of the best friend of the best friend , even though that &apos;s a horrible <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a horrible discussion , if you don &apos;t <unk> the bad and you <unk> that you never get a horrible horrible . </s>
if you &apos;re never going to do it , and the mistakes never back . </s>
this is the kind of <unk> shame . </s>
the most unhealthy way of thinking about is the one in the <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s the one that says that you don &apos;t do what you did is not bad , but it &apos;s the self . </s>
and that was what i felt . </s>
and it was not at my <unk> , he was very gentle . </s>
he was talking to me with family and i &apos;m sure he was able to get the golf ball and safely and <unk> . </s>
but i asked myself to ask these questions . </s>
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i get her home ? </s>
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a smart mistake ? </s>
why am i walked in medicine ? </s>
slowly it &apos;s going to be . </s>
i started to feel better . </s>
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke down and the sun broke me back to myself . </s>
and i was at my thinking that if i never entered my efforts and never meet a mistake that &apos;s voice the voice . </s>
and she did it . </s>
and i worked on . </s>
and then it &apos;s again . </s>
two years later , i had a service in <unk> in a <unk> hospital from toronto , and i was <unk> a 25 years old . </s>
it was a lot of los and i was in there . </s>
he always showed up . </s>
i looked at the <unk> and it was a little pink pink . </s>
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him . </s>
and he showed up the door of his <unk> . </s>
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in her office . </s>
and she said the three words : one of you are you ? </s>
&quot; do you remember the patient &apos;s patients ? &quot; </s>
it turned out to be a <unk> . </s>
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> . </s>
you can see the neat , but it &apos;s not a natural part of the <unk> , and causing the top of the <unk> . </s>
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t know . </s>
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later . </s>
and i went through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , and i went through the same <unk> and again , again , it happened to work again and again . </s>
in a <unk> , i have two time . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of a lot of things , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s only 14 patients per patient night . </s>
i sent her home in both cases , and there were probably no way that we were treated in their treatment . </s>
and i thought , he was supposed to be <unk> . </s>
i <unk> the x-ray of kidneys . and when it was <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient &apos;s patient , my colleague at the bottom of the patient and calling the <unk> . </s>
the other people have been diarrhea . </s>
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him , too , too , too , too . </s>
and he did , when he got a <unk> in the right sector , he called the <unk> . </s>
in both cases , it was good . </s>
both of my favorite cases of mine , <unk> me . </s>
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes was just recently in the first five years , which is many of my colleagues , but total bullshit nonsense . </s>
some of my favorite years ago , in the last five years . </s>
it was not a support . </s>
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not talking about my mistakes and you can talk about , if i &apos;m not going to be the silent voice , which is really not what i can do with my fellow ? </s>
how can i teach you teach them to teach them that they weren &apos;t the same thing ? </s>
if i was a room in a space , like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me . </s>
when when you heard the last time of talking about someone &apos;s heard about <unk> <unk> about <unk> . </s>
oh , you go to a cocktail party and you may expect to be a little bit , but you may not hear someone else &apos;s own mistakes . </s>
if i &apos;m a room with colleagues , and to tell their immediate support , and they were telling them what i &apos;ve just told you about , i would have been probably not the end of the second story , you would actually make the issue of the second . </s>
and in fact , if i knew my colleague , a <unk> in my hospital , the wrong thing , believe me in my hospital , then believe me to look at problems in my eyes . </s>
this is the system that we live . </s>
it &apos;s a totally novel of mistakes . </s>
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones who make mistakes and those without limitation , which are not making the <unk> <unk> , and the ones that have good outcomes , who are good with good outcomes and the <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s almost a ideological response to antibodies , who had a human response . </s>
and there are the idea that if we were to the ones that make mistakes , we &apos;re going to have a food system . </s>
but there are two problems . </s>
in my first age of medical school , and journalism i have a personal medical study over medical failures and wrong , and wrong , i &apos;m going to show the toronto star to my first star , black <unk> , black way , black way , in learning . </s>
and what i learned is that mistakes is absolutely <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re working in a system where every day of 10 <unk> either have a wrong or wrong , and it &apos;s wrong in the <unk> and devastation and devastation and devastation or dead . </s>
in this state , about 44,000 <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
in the united states , the <unk> medicine , the number of 100,000 dollars . </s>
both of the strong strong , because we &apos;re not seeing the problem as we should look at the same as we should think . </s>
and it &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
in a toy seller in the <unk> in the medical community , every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up . </s>
<unk> is ubiquitous . </s>
we can &apos;t get rid of it . </s>
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with a patient . </s>
i take the same patient with <unk> , <unk> him and <unk> and skill and give them a slightly breath and a whole life cycle . </s>
i don &apos;t take the same course . </s>
i &apos;m not always a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things . </s>
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms , they &apos;re the same . </s>
all of the things you have is . </s>
so , if you take the system as i was taught it , and all of the <unk> <unk> , then at the end of the end , it &apos;s at the end of the end . </s>
and you know , the <unk> of people who want to speak about their worst cases ? </s>
in my mind , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; black art , &quot; i &apos;d like to say , &quot; this is my favorite mistake &quot; , &quot; this is my favorite mistake &quot; , &quot; this is my favorite mistake &quot; , &quot; this is my favorite mistake &quot; , &quot; and then i &apos;ll show him a doctor , &quot; and then i &apos;ll show him with the
and then your pupils pay , they &apos;re just going down , and then you look down , and the <unk> and the hard stories , and start to tell her stories . </s>
they want to tell their stories . they want their stories . </s>
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot; </s>
what she &apos;s doing is a environment that you &apos;re doing . </s>
what she needs to do is we have a new medical culture . </s>
and it begins with a doctor . </s>
the new york doctor is a human being , white to make his humanity , but it all goes to the failure , but it all goes from you to learn that . </s>
they surrounded their experiences . </s>
they talk about their mistakes . </s>
and they showed their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a sense , a <unk> , may have been hearing about it . </s>
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that people have the system with life and when that &apos;s so , then , the system is actually the time . </s>
so the system has evolved to make the building blocks of the error , and even the health care system , and even the health care system , and even the health care system and even the specifically , as i do , and that &apos;s what makes them , the mistakes of those industries that are <unk> . </s>
my name is brian . </s>
i &apos;m a doctor &apos;s <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes . </s>
i &apos;m trying to learn a <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn to learn from this to learn . </s>
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to be in me . </s>
let me conclude with three words : i remember , i remember . </s>
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little bit of a little bit . </s>
it &apos;s about <unk> . </s>
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you about three stories to use the time . </s>
the first one is about charles darwin , one of my heroes . </s>
you know , he was here he was here . </s>
you might think that he &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true . </s>
he actually fish . </s>
he &apos;d like to say one of them as a very . </s>
it was a <unk> . </s>
in the &apos; 80s , he was convicted in a great way of making it . </s>
he &apos;s in red list . </s>
this story is we have a lot of times from the galapagos or from others , it &apos;s not very special . </s>
however , the more we still come in . </s>
we still think of the other . </s>
the <unk> still describe them as a time . </s>
what happened here is what happened ? </s>
second story is a different concept that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , actually , enlightened . </s>
because i was a lagoon in <unk> , and i was a lagoon in <unk> . </s>
i went to the left , because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa . </s>
i thought i &apos;d be able to integrate . </s>
and i got a terrible <unk> , and i convinced that i really don &apos;t really work . </s>
it was my first <unk> . </s>
as you see , the lagoon of <unk> and a few <unk> <unk> . </s>
there was <unk> from about 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> . </s>
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen lived well and <unk> in ghana . </s>
when i was 27 years later , the fish was fleeing to the halfway around half of the size . </s>
it &apos;s five centimeters . </s>
they were funded by <unk> . </s>
they were still fishes . </s>
people were happy . </s>
and the fish also had the privilege to be there . </s>
so , it changed everything else , and yet changed everything . </s>
my third little story of my favorite story was <unk> in southeast asia . </s>
in &apos; 70s -- rather than the 1960s -- <unk> europe , many <unk> . </s>
<unk> <unk> , who had been 100 ugly fish , the industrial fishing fishing <unk> <unk> , <unk> taniyama &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
i was driving forward and particularly in the entire southern <unk> , and especially in the <unk> . </s>
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started . </s>
i know that it was the reason for the sea . </s>
ninety percent of our most advanced our most advanced our most advanced , are the associated with the cause . </s>
the greatest part of fish that little there was on the rubble , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
basically , the reason was in <unk> and then became <unk> , and then <unk> . </s>
these pictures are extraordinarily quick , because the transition goes very quickly . </s>
within one year , you get a <unk> through , and then we start with the waste intelligence and then with the intelligence . </s>
the reason is changing -- in this case , in this case -- a lack of lack of lack of a lack of lack of <unk> . </s>
this is a dead turtle . </s>
they were not eating them , they threw them up because they were dead . </s>
we started a <unk> . </s>
she wasn &apos;t yet <unk> . </s>
they wanted them to kill them well . </s>
in fact , this mountain of shrimp every time you get from fishermen in areas where they &apos;re in places where they &apos;re never going to explode . </s>
it won &apos;t be <unk> . </s>
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it . </s>
we adapt our misery to the new level of technology and shouting and call us not in memory . </s>
if you saw it . </s>
on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity , number of the <unk> , the green of their country , the green <unk> . </s>
with the time , it changes it . it changes because of the people are their actions actions . </s>
every generation of the generation that you think of the imagery of their lives , and it &apos;s going to be a bit of it . </s>
the difference is going to be a loss . </s>
but they don &apos;t take the benefits . </s>
it can give you a sequence of changes . </s>
and at the end , they just get the <unk> remains . </s>
that &apos;s actually a blind system . </s>
we want to preserve things that are not as the things that are not so much as they were . </s>
you may think that the problem people who have been able to take people who certainly had certainly affected in <unk> societies , animals , and only some generations , just after some generations , which they did . </s>
because obviously , a animal is very often , it just happened to be a very common thing before it was <unk> . </s>
so , you lose a lot of money to animals . </s>
you &apos;re always animals . </s>
and that &apos;s why not a great loss . </s>
with the time , we &apos;re looking at the big animals and in sea are the big fish . </s>
they &apos;re just <unk> because we &apos;re going to catch them . </s>
with the time , the time , the <unk> is a bit of the <unk> . </s>
the question is , why humans are the people . </s>
now , it was a different way of seeing . </s>
of course , many people , scientist , confirm it . </s>
they will confirm it , because the evidence , as you know , as you can form a violent shape , not as they would love the evidence of the evidence . </s>
for instance , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a <unk> that &apos;s been in this area of <unk> , not being used by <unk> , not being used by <unk> , because he &apos;s not going to be a scientifically . </s>
so we &apos;ve got the situation that people don &apos;t know , even though we live in the world because they didn &apos;t have the sources of the past . </s>
it shows the enormously large role that a marine can play a marine marine reserve . </s>
by the way , we &apos;ve basically got the past again . </s>
we &apos;ve got to imagine again that people can &apos;t understand that because the <unk> changes have changed and very low . </s>
so , that people who have a marine marine collection and the one of the people who are doing it , it enables to be able to use their <unk> . </s>
what about the people who don &apos;t know what they &apos;re not allowed because they don &apos;t have access to the example of the bottom of the bottom in the middle ? </s>
so here i think the art and the film , maybe the gap , the gap . </s>
this is the simulation bay bay . </s>
a long time ago , there was <unk> years ago . </s>
and the <unk> and <unk> , they may be <unk> . </s>
if you think about &quot; avatar &quot; , if you think about why people were so touched by that touched -- apart from the <unk> , why were they so used to be so touched by the <unk> ? </s>
because it &apos;s a little bit of a bit in a sense of that . </s>
so my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give , in some way , so he &apos;s called &quot; the water &quot; <unk> . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
in the &apos; 80s , in communist <unk> , you had to have a typewriter that we had to do a typewriter that we &apos;re seeing with the government . </s>
they had to be a sheet of <unk> from that typewriter . </s>
the reason for the government could be , where a text is a text . </s>
and they found a paper with <unk> <unk> , who were asking the <unk> of those thoughts . </s>
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do anything like that could do something like that could do , and how much the organism was . </s>
we &apos;d never done anything like this . </s>
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , a new <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and one side of a sudden , then , this site has <unk> yellow <unk> on each side of <unk> , and they &apos;re clearly their desktop <unk> . </s>
this is what happens today . </s>
and they seem to be <unk> . </s>
and this was an example of what our own governments governments to us , the citizens , it &apos;s going to be . </s>
and this is one of the three <unk> of the world today . </s>
let &apos;s see what really happened to the world : we can split the attacks in the category . </s>
we have three <unk> . </s>
there is <unk> . </s>
for instance , mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> in the ukraine . </s>
and the motives are very easy to understand . </s>
these people deserve money . </s>
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money . </s>
there are several well-known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who have money through attacks . </s>
this is <unk> <unk> in estonia . </s>
this is alfred hitchcock . </s>
stephen watts . </s>
<unk> <unk> . </s>
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth . </s>
these people have online meetings , but they have it basically in using our <unk> , using our money to prevent money from our insatiable , while we &apos;re doing a foot , and also <unk> our money to the keyboard over the keyboard , while we have a infected computer online . </s>
the <unk> billion two months ago in two months ago , the swiss shoots of mr. <unk> , and on this particular conference , offering had been released for it . </s>
mr. &apos;s self is on the foot of the <unk> . </s>
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more probable today that we &apos;re victims of a <unk> of a <unk> in the real world . </s>
and it &apos;s very clear that this is even worse . </s>
in the future , most of the crime are online online . </s>
the second largest <unk> we can see today , not through money . </s>
they &apos;re through something else , protests , <unk> , a opinion , or a catcher , or through her . </s>
groups like anonymous are over the past 12 months and are on a field of <unk> on the field of <unk> . </s>
so these are three <unk> : the potential of the money , the potential of the money , <unk> how failure that are the <unk> , but the last group are nations in the attacks . </s>
there are a way of <unk> , like <unk> . </s>
it shows what happens when governments could be able to attack their own citizens . </s>
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- it was that it was . </s>
in the last fall , it had to be made by <unk> <unk> . </s>
somebody was , and had the system of hacked . </s>
and last week with a dutch <unk> , i &apos;m a senior one of the senior one that he could do for possible , i &apos;m sure whether he died of the <unk> people were died . </s>
and his response was &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
now , as people in a real mind ? </s>
<unk> is a <unk> . </s>
they sell <unk> . </s>
what do you do with <unk> ? </s>
now , a certificate of you need to take a website with <unk> , with <unk> , for example . </s>
now we &apos;re using all of the time , or many of us , or a lot of us , or a <unk> , but these services are particularly encrypted in <unk> states , so the local government is not in their own <unk> , so they &apos;re not <unk> in their own terms . </s>
can you live in a foreign office in a foreign office </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . </s>
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of <unk> . </s>
how do you get to the arab spring and the things that happened to be a lot of years ? </s>
now in egypt , the <unk> in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of <unk> . </s>
in this room , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
and in this folder , in this folder , in this folder , a <unk> , the egyptian government had a few programs that they were -- in very much , very much , -- the communication government could actually be able to learn . </s>
they had this program for the egyptian government . </s>
this is exactly here . </s>
so , in latin america , governments <unk> governments to be able to get their own citizens . </s>
but western governments help themselves . </s>
for instance , in germany , a few weeks ago , the <unk> <unk> found , that was a <unk> member that was used by german <unk> to <unk> her own citizens . </s>
if you &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> , then with a security <unk> <unk> . </s>
but today we &apos;ve gained far . </s>
they tap their internet . </s>
they use resources like the <unk> to help your computer with a <unk> who allows them to monitor their computer , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> . </s>
so , if we think about things , then the obvious answer would be , &quot; ok , &quot; that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t change me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen . </s>
i don &apos;t have to worry about ! </s>
i &apos;ve got nothing to hide . &quot; </s>
and this argument is not a sense . </s>
privacy has to be given . </s>
privacy is not to debate . </s>
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety . </s>
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control . </s>
and as we &apos;re in 2011 today , our governments are like , but every right that we &apos;re trying to do , for that we make , for that . </s>
and we trust we trust trust to a future future , a government that we may have been about in the middle . </s>
these are the questions that we have to have the next 50 years . </s>
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> . </s>
the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> from cement , the <unk> . </s>
<unk> <unk> became the most <unk> <unk> in the world . </s>
they &apos;re also exploring us to build things that were larger than we were , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other . </s>
basically , the <unk> of our time was to become the <unk> of our time . </s>
almost a hundred years later , came out of a <unk> . </s>
it was called the <unk> rock . </s>
and within a few years , i have a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion rocks has been produced -- or 75 rocks for any person on this planet . </s>
they don &apos;t need to be a engineer to create mothers , beautiful bridges . </s>
lego did for everyone . </s>
lego has basically the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , and that &apos;s what we did for our imagination . </s>
in the meanwhile , the bell was labs in the same year , the next revolution , the next revolution . </s>
the transistor was a little <unk> that was coming from a world of the <unk> , <unk> building blocks in the world . </s>
like the <unk> , allows us to build the transistor much bigger , more prosperous to build more complex . </s>
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just experts . </s>
personally , i don &apos;t accept the case that the time for our experts &apos;s been working on , and so i decided to change that . </s>
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started to explore this idea how to make the power of artists and designers . </s>
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> . </s>
let me show you how to do . </s>
<unk> is electronic <unk> that have a specific function . </s>
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound and sensor . </s>
and the best part of this is that they connect to the magnet . </s>
so they can &apos;t sit around . </s>
rocks . </s>
green is a common blue , is current is electricity , is the <unk> and orange . </s>
all you need to do is a blue and a green and a green and a green and a whole other way of all the <unk> . </s>
you put a blue on a green , and they can make light . </s>
you can have a switch in a little <unk> , and they created a little <unk> . </s>
take the switch off the switch of a <unk> , which is here , and they made a little <unk> . </s>
you put that <unk> for a single movement and you have a <unk> <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m going to stop the stop . </s>
over the simple play , it actually is quite a <unk> . </s>
instead of having to code , <unk> or <unk> to program , allows them to program to code . </s>
so , to slow down the <unk> , just turn it up and just go on this button and he does the momentum . </s>
the idea behind the <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library . </s>
we want to put every single interaction in a <unk> stone . </s>
lights , jesus , <unk> , motors -- all the time . </s>
we have <unk> of children and they &apos;re playing with it . </s>
and it was an incredible experience . </s>
the most beautiful thing is how they start the electronics that they &apos;re going to understand in the daily lives and they don &apos;t learn to school . </s>
for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how a ipod responds to the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
we also have <unk> also . </s>
so we had to do the case for example , designers , with no experience , who started with <unk> <unk> . </s>
here we see , with <unk> , paper and <unk> , like <unk> ... </s>
a few weeks ago we have <unk> <unk> to risd and gave them some designers that were unique technical experiences -- just love , wood and paper -- and said , &quot; what &apos;s what . &quot; </s>
here &apos;s a example of a project that she made them a <unk> <unk> . </s>
but wait here is my favorite thing . </s>
it &apos;s a <unk> from fear , who fear in the dark . </s>
for this <unk> , <unk> one more material , electronics just got a death material . </s>
and we want to do this stuff for all available available . </s>
so <unk> source is <unk> . </s>
you can go to the website , and they make the <unk> , and they make themselves . </s>
we want the world of creators , the inventors , the <unk> <unk> , because of the world that we &apos;re in living world , belongs . </s>
so they go to the train . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
