&quot; no . &quot; </s>
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , that &apos;s not too much . </s>
other aspects of life that are much more nuanced than the purchase of objects , the same explosion of the choices . </s>
health care -- it &apos;s not longer than the united states in the united states , and the doctor &apos;s going to tell you what to do . </s>
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , we could make a difference or we could do b . </s>
a guy has to come and risk . </s>
b is this benefits and risk . what do you want to do ? </s>
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot; </s>
the doctor says , a failure has this benefits and the risks and b has the benefits of the benefits . </s>
do you want to do ? </s>
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doc , what would you do ? &quot; </s>
doctor &apos;s office , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot; </s>
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy &quot; -- that sounds like a good thing , but it sounds a shift for the other thing , but it sounds not ill , and therefore , is an honest amount of someone &apos;s much white thing , but it sounds sick and therefore , is not ill , and therefore , is not ill , and therefore ,
there are a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like they and me , if you think about it , because we don &apos;t buy them . </s>
why is it that they can &apos;t buy , if we don &apos;t buy ? </s>
the answer is : you expect to get from us to <unk> the next morning and to ask a change in the face . </s>
so , something like our identity is now a question of choice , how do you show this slide . </s>
we don &apos;t like we have a identity , we invent them . </s>
and we often know how we want to do . </s>
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , they decide what kind of person you want to be . </s>
and in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the <unk> was that almost every one had a had had a <unk> and they could quickly as quickly as they could , and then quickly as quickly as they could . </s>
the only thing was said , &quot; who are not when , and not what they did . </s>
nowadays , today , it &apos;s easy . </s>
i teach the wonderful students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less than i used to do . </s>
and not because they are less clever , and not because they &apos;re less carefully . </s>
it &apos;s because they &apos;re wondering , &quot; i shall not marry or not ? i should get married ? </s>
should i get married ? should i have kids , or just do you do ? &quot; </s>
these are all <unk> . </s>
and you &apos;ll be able to predict that that means all of the tasks that i &apos;m going to show you and i &apos;m not a good grade of my class . </s>
and in fact , they should do this . these are important questions . </s>
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl , as carl , each every single person has to each day from each other to each day from each other , that &apos;s going to work on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel . </s>
there &apos;s a corner of the things that i &apos;m going to tell you about that works . </s>
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it . </s>
so what it means is that incredible freedoms of choice , we &apos;re going to make sure about jobs , again and again , whether we should work or not work . </s>
we can play our children in the football , and we have our mobile phone at the time , and our blackberry , and our blackberry , probably on our lap . </s>
and even if you &apos;re all the people , every minute in the <unk> , we ask a <unk> <unk> , we should ask ourselves , &quot; i should go through this call &quot; ? </s>
should i reply that i should write this letter ? &quot; </s>
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s going to be sure your experience of your child would be very different than it was . </s>
anywhere , big things and little things , physical things , and lifestyle , life is a question of choice . </s>
and the world that we were living in the world . </s>
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all the choice of choice . </s>
and the world we &apos;re looking at now . </s>
and the question is , is the good or bad news ? </s>
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
we all know what good is , so i &apos;m going to talk about what is miserable . </s>
all of these choices are two effects of the negative effects . </s>
a effect , <unk> way , is that it &apos;s beginning to be <unk> . </s>
with so many options of the people , you can really find it even to decide . </s>
i &apos;m going to give you another example of a study of investment in volunteers . </s>
so , a colleague from me , access to <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different range of different different kinds of different jobs . </s>
and what she found was a 10 <unk> that the gas is <unk> , the participation was participation to two percent . </s>
they would offer 50 percent of the time -- 10 percent less employees than if they were just five . why ? </s>
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are to vote , it &apos;s so hard to decide that they &apos;re going to vote on tomorrow . </s>
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow . </s>
understand that this is not just the time that people are going to drink the people , the people have to eat the people , if you go to the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to the time that they &apos;re missing is that they &apos;re missing in big charge of your employers . </s>
not a way to 5,000 dollars a year , a year , a year on the <unk> , the great <unk> had been completed . </s>
paralysis is a consequence of many choices . </s>
and i think it &apos;s very much about that , is that the world looks like . </s>
they really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ? </s>
they don &apos;t want to pick the wrong ones , or even the wrong thing . </s>
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we make the paralysis and make a decision , we end with the outcome of the choices , when we had the opportunity to decide . </s>
and there are several reasons for this . </s>
one of them is about the major selection of different <unk> , if you buy one , and that &apos;s just the satisfaction that they had to live in the satisfaction that they had , and that &apos;s kind of <unk> the satisfaction that they had to do another thing , even if it was a good decision . </s>
the more things that are easier to regret is nothing to vote that they &apos;re going to meet . </s>
secondly , what economists call <unk> . </s>
dan gilbert has a big point in the morning he just begun to tell you how much the kinds of things we compare it to what we &apos;re going to compare it . </s>
well , if there &apos;s lots of alternative alternatives to remember , it &apos;s just a <unk> properties of alternative that they &apos;re doing less content that they voted with the alternative that they &apos;ve chosen . </s>
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize . </s>
but here &apos;s what they should be thinking . </s>
here &apos;s a few of the ones . </s>
very expensive . </s>
beautiful beach . great day . they &apos;ve got it all for themselves . </s>
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; the man is , &quot; it &apos;s august . &quot; </s>
everyone in my <unk> is gone . </s>
i could park my house . &quot; </s>
and he spends two weeks of the thoughts that he &apos;s missed the opportunity to have some great parking lot . </s>
<unk> <unk> is the satisfaction that we &apos;re feeding through our choices , even if that what we chose is fantastic . </s>
and the more ways there are the opportunity to vote that are more attractive properties of these selection into the <unk> . </s>
here &apos;s another example . </s>
well , this cartoon makes some statements . </s>
he &apos;s doing a statement about it in the right now , and maybe things really slowly . </s>
but a more important point that he &apos;s doing is that they choose to choose to decide who they &apos;re not going to do other things . </s>
and these other things like that , many of you have more mature , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do is make a difference . </s>
third : <unk> of expectations . </s>
this was me when i was my jeans . </s>
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time . </s>
and there was a time in which there was just a kind of time , and they bought them for a long enough time , they were <unk> , and if they had a long enough of them and often enough , they started pouring . </s>
so for many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few of the jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot; </s>
and the merchant said , &quot; you want to be <unk> , slightly <unk> or gloom ? </s>
do you want to push or <unk> ? rock or acid ? </s>
do they want to feed holes ? </s>
if you want to be far lower , <unk> , blah blah blah , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on . </s>
my jaw was down , and after i said , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the kind of the kind of thing that was the way that the only way was the only way . &quot; </s>
he had no idea what was that , so i spent an hour with all these damn jeans <unk> , and i say the truth -- with the drugs , i &apos;ve ever been doing the truth -- i mean , jeans that i ever had . </s>
i had better . all these choices make it better . </s>
but i felt bad . </s>
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
the reason i was poor about was worse with all these things , my expectations of being a good pair of jeans , went to a good pair of jeans , went to a good pair of jeans , went to a good pair of jeans . </s>
i had low expectations . i had no concrete expectations of being a kind of thing . </s>
when they came to 100 species , damn a <unk> of them should have perfect , should have perfect . </s>
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect . </s>
and so i found myself to what i was expected , and what i had expected to be in comparison with what i expected . </s>
the ability to do the ability to people , people can find people understand how well that opportunity will be . </s>
and this is a little less satisfaction with the results that are good , even though they &apos;re good . </s>
no one in the world of the <unk> knows , because if you would , you know , they all won &apos;t all about that . </s>
the truth is more like this . </s>
the reason is all better than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was for people to blame experiences that were a pleasant surprise . </s>
today , in the world we live in -- we &apos;re making sure , narrow citizens , with perfection as being -- the best you are ever going to do is that you &apos;re doing , that &apos;s kind of like you expect it from them . </s>
they never become <unk> because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> . </s>
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you &apos;re all the rest of the time -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations . </s>
i want to say -- a brand-new <unk> moment -- i &apos;m going to be married , and she &apos;s really wonderful . </s>
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i haven &apos;t <unk> me . </s>
but <unk> is not always a bad thing . </s>
ultimately , one consequence of the <unk> is a bad thing about a bad species of a bad species of a bad species is that if you &apos;re unhappy , and they &apos;re wondering why , who &apos;s really , who is responsible , and the world is accountable . what would you do ? </s>
if hundreds of different species are available to be available , and they buy a <unk> , and you &apos;re asking why who &apos;s responsible ? </s>
is it equally clear that the answer is : they &apos;re going to be . </s>
they would have been doing better . </s>
with 100 different jeans , there &apos;s no excuse for mistake . </s>
and so if people make decisions , and also when the result of decisions are they feel disappointed , feel disappointed , they feel disappointed . </s>
depression wide in the last generation , there &apos;s the last generation . </s>
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> is to this explosion of the depression , and also , if you have to engage these experiences , think about their blame . </s>
and so the <unk> that we &apos;re going to do is , and we feel bad . </s>
so let me remember . </s>
this is the official <unk> that we &apos;re all right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true . </s>
there &apos;s no question , which is more likely to be better than not , but it &apos;s not that more selection is better than something is true . </s>
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is . </s>
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point to the point where we have the same satellite . </s>
now , as a transaction question -- i &apos;m almost done as a kind of thing that &apos;s going to think about the right thing . what all these selection is possible to be in the industrialized societies is the material wealth . </s>
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them , whose problem is not the too big choice . </s>
you know , you have too little , you know , they &apos;re too little . </s>
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a major issue of modern , rich , west societies . </s>
and what &apos;s like frustrating and says , steve <unk> has told them about how this is expensive and difficult to <unk> car seats , it &apos;s a waste of money . </s>
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them . </s>
they even hurts . </s>
they &apos;re worried about it , we &apos;re going to stand worse . </s>
if something matters about what makes people to make decisions to the societies in which people were not only the least of the people , not only the life of people , but it would also be enhanced . </s>
economists call this a <unk> application . </s>
<unk> is going to insure that it &apos;s all the way that is -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are going to be <unk> . </s>
and , reading this cartoon , and she &apos;s a square person , says , &quot; ah ! what &apos;s this fish ? </s>
you don &apos;t know anything that can happen in this <unk> . &quot; </s>
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first . </s>
the more i was going to be more about it , the more i got to the actual view that fish has a little white . </s>
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t freedom freedom . they have paralysis . they have paralysis . </s>
if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , they &apos;re tuned the satisfaction . </s>
they &apos;re attracted to the satisfaction and the satisfaction . </s>
everybody needs a <unk> . </s>
this is almost a perfect supply -- possibly as a fish , definitely for us . </s>
but the <unk> is his name &apos;s <unk> , and i think , is a <unk> . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what that means , and the discovery could mean to genes , and the discoveries of new groups of genes . </s>
in fact , we &apos;re going to start by a new point : we &apos;re getting the biology of biology and now we &apos;re going to try and we now try to get a new phase of biology in the biology and build new life . </s>
we always have significant questions . </s>
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have to try to understand and that on different levels of levels . </s>
we tried different approaches to simplify the <unk> components . </s>
we &apos;ve been getting almost 20 years , and when we &apos;ve been sequenced the <unk> of the world &apos;s own biology in biology biology . </s>
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate life or new lives , from this digital universe ? </s>
this is the map of a little organism , <unk> <unk> , which is the tiniest genome of a species that has been able to replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to achieve that with a broader possible genome . </s>
we &apos;ve managed to get about a hundred genes from 500 or so , these are . </s>
but if we look at this metabolic <unk> , which is very simple , to ours , versus our own , trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we look at these genes , we can all rise to the other person , it &apos;s really unlikely that this is going to lead to a living cell . </s>
so we decided that there &apos;s the only way to get this chromosome , this chromosome will actually allow us to get the individual components and thus ask some of these fundamental questions . </s>
and so we started to ask the question , we can make a chromosome ? </s>
and then it allows the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which never before before ? </s>
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ? </s>
a chromosome is so a <unk> chemical chemical material . </s>
our steps in the breast cancer was devastating . </s>
our ability to write code has evolved very slowly , but nevertheless , it would have to take a exponential curve . </s>
we started 15 years ago . </s>
it took some years ago with a <unk> before we did the first experiments . </s>
how are a very difficult idea to be very difficult . </s>
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world around the world around the world around the world around the world around dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you do a piece of power , it &apos;s more common . </s>
so we had to develop a new method that we had to put these little bits and mistakes the mistakes . </s>
this was our first attempt to predict the digital information , the genome of the genome is the first x 174 . </s>
it &apos;s a little virus of the bacteria . </s>
we made little bits of <unk> , and had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters . </s>
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical <unk> and into a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code , and it &apos;s viral particles . </s>
the viral particles were then taken from the cells and come back and killing the <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ve talked about the oil industry , and they said that they are doing this model . </s>
they laughed more than you &apos;re doing here . </s>
so think that that &apos;s a situation in the software that actually build your own hardware in a biological system . </s>
but we wanted to build a lot more on , we wanted to build a whole bunch of <unk> chromosome , and it has more than <unk> letters , so we could build it in the size of the virus , we could put it in the size of the virus , we could put it in the size of the virus , we could put it in the size
design is the key to , and when you &apos;re going to launch with digital information in the computer , that digital information needs to be really going to be really . </s>
when we first saw the genome in 1995 , the mujahideen <unk> was a mistake for a mistake . </s>
we found 30 30 kilometers , if we were used the original sequence , it would never be possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have been used for <unk> . </s>
part of the design is to make the 50 letters and the ones that are <unk> with other <unk> , to get smaller <unk> in order to build smaller arrangements . </s>
we have unique elements here . </s>
you may have heard more <unk> . </s>
think about it : a , c , g and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and t. , and
<unk> of this letters -- this letters is about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a different purpose of these amino acids . </s>
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , sentences , thoughts . </s>
initially , we &apos;ve just signed up . </s>
some people were willing to be no poetry . </s>
we &apos;ve been so eloquently that we could just couldn &apos;t make them , there are enzymes that they can fix these power and <unk> . </s>
and we &apos;ve been studying pieces of making pieces , starting with the <unk> letters , in the middle of the <unk> <unk> , in the middle of the <unk> to make these back to <unk> . </s>
in each step , we could produce this one in the right order to sequence them because we could take a very robust process to create a very robust process . </s>
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the <unk> . </s>
so , this looks like a <unk> . </s>
if we get to these right tall areas -- with 100,000 things -- you won &apos;t just grow these two choices in the modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;re going to save ourselves . </s>
we knew from a mechanism called the <unk> called <unk> , the biology uses dna to produce dna , can split these pieces of devices . </s>
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism named <unk> <unk> for three million rads of radiation . </s>
you see that his chromosome are just going to be the chromosome . </s>
twenty-four hours , everything was going back to 24 hours , everything was . </s>
we have thousands of organisms that can do that . </s>
these organisms can be really bright , they can actually live in the vacuum . </s>
i &apos;m absolutely sure in space , and move to move to <unk> conditions . </s>
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s been much more of that there . </s>
here &apos;s a <unk> photograph of the molecule , we &apos;ve made these processes -- actually we use these processes -- actually we use <unk> , we have <unk> them , and yeast <unk> it automatically . </s>
this is not a <unk> <unk> , <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can see it even as a big molecule . </s>
these are recordings of six seconds , and this is a <unk> of six seconds . </s>
this is the publication that we &apos;ve been just recently done . </s>
this is what &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that ever created by people . </s>
it has a <unk> of over 300 million . </s>
if we had a <unk> of 10 and without intelligence agencies , it would give you <unk> pages to get this genetic code . </s>
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how we activate it ? </s>
obviously , it &apos;s a virus very simple , it &apos;s much more complicated with germs . </s>
it &apos;s also easier to do it in the <unk> , like we &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re taking out the nucleus and there &apos;s another one , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve done about this . </s>
<unk> is the chromosome in the cell , but we &apos;ve only recently shown that you could have a complete transplanting of a chromosome , from one of the cell , and that can activate that . </s>
we <unk> the chromosome , a <unk> . and so , roughly , these two are far from humans and mice . we <unk> it with enzymes to disrupt a way we could choose this . we use it to disrupt chromosome . we <unk> it with enzymes to be able to estimate this . </s>
the new chromosome went into the cell . </s>
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we try to get a little bit more on the process . </s>
this is the <unk> of evolution . </s>
we find all sorts of species that are a second chromosome chromosome , or a third of <unk> , every time of thousands of relatives in a second , a species . </s>
so people who think about evolution has been a gene in biology . </s>
there are enzymes called the <unk> , they &apos;re actually digest . </s>
the chromosome that &apos;s in the cell , we &apos;ve been doing no ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve been missing . </s>
it was convicted of <unk> and recognized the other chromosome as an instrument , and so we ended up at the end of the end of it . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> blue , because of the genes that we had . </s>
and after a very short time , there was all the characteristics of species and <unk> in a new species based on the new software we &apos;ve given in the cell . </s>
all the proteins are shifted to the membranes , and when we read the genetic code , we read it exactly what we &apos;ve missed . </s>
it may like <unk> <unk> , but we can &apos;t change the <unk> , things quite dramatically . </s>
now i &apos;m suggesting this is not the <unk> -- the <unk> is based on a billion years of evolution , evolution has gone out of evolution . </s>
and i &apos;ve got the other way that we might have a new shape of the cambrian explosion in the <unk> , based on the digital design based on this digital design . </s>
why should we do that ? </s>
i think it &apos;s very obvious in what we need . </s>
we are nine billion people in the next 40 years , in the next 40 years . </s>
to provide it in my context , i was born in the year . </s>
today , three people on this planet for every year , has been four of the year , in the year , it will be four years . </s>
we have problems with food , with the <unk> and clean water , medicine , fuel , 71 , <unk> people . </s>
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine . </s>
we need to be about five billion tons of coal oil , <unk> billion <unk> margin , which are 100 billion dollars in the day . </s>
if we can think about biological processes or a process to replace that , it &apos;s a huge challenge . </s>
then , of course , there &apos;s all of the co2 from this material that &apos;s going on in the atmosphere . </s>
now , we &apos;ve got from our discoveries of all over the world , a database of roughly 20 million genes , and i want to believe that the future of the future are . </s>
the <unk> had a dozen components and see it &apos;s the diversity of the line . </s>
we &apos;re seeing here in the limits of the biological reality and to think of this . </s>
we have technologies today to be the fast to do what we call <unk> . </s>
we have the opportunity to build a big robot of chromosomes to make the day . </s>
if you &apos;re going to make these 20 million different genes , or these processes to optimize to optimize for <unk> , we can make a more sophisticated team more than the last 20 years . </s>
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on . </s>
this is a photograph of <unk> at the time that you actually lose a look at the one and new species on the computer and new species on the computer . </s>
you know , we don &apos;t know how to look like , we can look at what we &apos;re going to look like this . </s>
we &apos;re going to focus on the fourth generation . </s>
you &apos;ve seen corn corn , which is just a bad experiment . </s>
we have the <unk> and third generation that will soon be going to be <unk> , which will be much higher , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> . </s>
but how do we think the only way that we think is a big increase of the costs without any augmentation on food or the limitation of their limitation , and therefore we &apos;re going to work on co2 that are going to be the way to go to see co2 , and therefore we &apos;re going to go to the cells that are going to go to the cells
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first ones with the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months . </s>

but in our discovery of the world , we all have different types of different ways . </s>
this is a organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 . </s>
he lives in deep deep , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> co2 in methane to use under hydrogen as the source of hydrogen as the source . </s>
we investigate whether we can use information co2 to get the easy co2 to be brought co2 into cognition , to get co2 into the <unk> system . </s>
within a quick period we could be able to solve the fundamental questions of life . </s>
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of the entire <unk> industry , and if you don &apos;t do that at any of you , where else ? a <unk> of energy . </s>
but as we &apos;ve been working on the same kinds of vaccines , and we &apos;re working on that the evolution of vaccines . </s>
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always seeing a year and have a dollar in the back of a dollar when it &apos;s about the right vaccine . </s>
i think that can be changed by hacking vaccines in the <unk> . </s>
this is what the future might be possibly can look like , can be <unk> with changes , can accelerate the <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> . </s>
we are a light years from people . our goal is just that we have a chance to do a chance to survive , and thank you very much , thank you very much . </s>
at the last ted conference , i was going to have a chance to go . </s>
and i promised them to tell you how the machine works . </s>
now it &apos;s so far as it . and for all those of those who were not there , the lhc is the greatest scientific experiment that ever addressed was addressed -- 27 miles . </s>
his job is to create conditions , which less than a second second in the universe of the universe , and it &apos;s about 600 million time in a second . </s>
it &apos;s just breathtaking <unk> . </s>
this is the machine underneath the world . </s>
we take pictures of this <unk> in detectors . </s>
at this work , it &apos;s called a <unk> -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter . </s>
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale . </s>

it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that takes the lhc of the lhc , then with a part of the lhc , <unk> to a rain of the lhc , to leave a rain from the detector . </s>
in other words , when we saw this slide on the 10th of the 10th , we knew that the machine works , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph . </s>
i don &apos;t know whether this is the biggest <unk> of the <unk> , or this , when somebody who went to visit and the front door . </s>
it means that we &apos;ve reached a cultural impact on the scientific literature . </s>
a week later there was a problem with these <unk> here -- these golden <unk> , this golden portrait here -- these golden <unk> here , here this golden portrait here . </s>
these are <unk> <unk> <unk> , when the machine goes on . </s>
well , the engineers amongst you are looking at them and say , &quot; no , no , no . these are little <unk> . &quot; </s>
you can afford to do it because if you &apos;re a very far , they &apos;ll be called <unk> . </s>
so basically , there &apos;s been the room between stars , can these <unk> that are <unk> . </s>
in one of the <unk> magnet , there was a <unk> . </s>
and by the way , by the wires , <unk> , <unk> resistance resistance resistance . </s>
this was the result . </s>
now , this is even more even when you imagine that the magnets are about 20 tons of <unk> and <unk> over about 20 inches . </s>
so we &apos;ve collected about 50 &apos;s magnets of the magnet of the magnet of the magnet of the magnet , we &apos;re damaged about 50 &apos;s magnet . </s>
and then they had to take what we did . </s>
we <unk> them , <unk> them . </s>
they &apos;re all over the back of your way back . </s>
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ll be able to get the <unk> , and expect to the june of june or july , and then <unk> our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are . </s>
now , of course , in a way , in a way , we have a kind of connected that debate about the value of science and <unk> to this borders . it &apos;s easy to do something like this . </s>
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to determine that we &apos;re talking about our limitations and reach out of our limitations , and the value of the lhc . </s>
i &apos;m going to talk about a researcher scientists like , <unk> <unk> , who , like i became , when he was defending the <unk> experiments , and i would have to be defending his <unk> , his <unk> are comfortable to nature that are not so much that our scientific ideas are comfortable to nature , and that there is no new worlds . &quot; </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m a novelist . </s>
books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that . </s>
it &apos;s also my big , calm and fascination . </s>
and i expect to change that the fact is the change . </s>
however , recent life is happening in my life and my career , that made me feel to do my work completely . </s>
this architect event was that i wrote a book called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who decided to do my previous books in the world , and a big <unk> , international <unk> . </s>
the result is that i &apos;m going to come , just as i &apos;m going to be the fall of the fall . </s>
seriously -- the fall , please ! </s>
for example , they &apos;re going to come up with me and say , &quot; don &apos;t stare them , don &apos;t they get this success . </s>
don &apos;t they have a fear of them that they &apos;re going to be saved your whole life , and never create a book , &quot; anyone who are in the world ? never ? </s>
okay , that &apos;s really what makes it really . </s>
it would be worse if i wasn &apos;t remember that i was going to be a teenager about 20 years ago when i first told the first time i was going to be a teenager , with the same kind of <unk> response . </s>
people said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about , in a fear , no success ? </s>
did not feel that you &apos;re thinking about the humiliation of a <unk> ? </s>
did you feel that you would have this citizen your life , and it never comes to a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter the bitter as <unk> ? </s>
so , you know , you know . </s>
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : <unk> . </s>
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all this . </s>
and i was always going to have . </s>
and i &apos;ve been afraid of stuff more stuff that no one would go . </s>
how algae -- and other things . </s>
but if there &apos;s been thinking about writing about writing , i think about it , and ask me , why ? </s>
is that the ultimate ? </s>
is it logically that by somebody &apos;s fear , trying to do the work ? </s>
and what is exactly with the creative <unk> that you &apos;re going to do is to make us more amazing , and in a way , how do you do it really do any other jobs ? </s>
my father , for example , i was chemist and i could not remember in his 40 years , in which he asked if he was afraid to be afraid . </s>
with your <unk> , john hockenberry -- how do you get it with it ? </s>
it just wasn &apos;t going to be just before you know ? </s>
but to be fair -- the group of chemist have been about to have the centuries of <unk> people . </s>
we &apos;re writers , but this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the <unk> that seem to have this call to be extracted in common . </s>
all you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of the 20th century , who are young and often died from the 20th century , and often have died . </s>
and even those who were not actually <unk> , seemed to be <unk> by their own <unk> . </s>
norman <unk> said , shortly before his death in his last interview , <unk> every one of my books has a little more prolific . </s>
a force force that they can do about their own . </s>
but we &apos;re not even given somebody when we say somebody &apos;s saying something because we &apos;ve been so appreciative of some of the gaps , because we &apos;ve been so appreciative of the gaps and suffering and <unk> , and that art -- and they &apos;re always doing art -- and they &apos;re always doing art . </s>
the question i want to ask each other here is : is this idea of doing this idea for them to be implanted ? </s>
feel with it , because with only one inch on a centimeter is looking at all -- i feel like that i haven &apos;t been comfortable with this notion . </s>
i find them to be . </s>
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t watch how they could take into the next century . </s>
i find it better if we encourage our big creative <unk> . </s>
and i know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous -- especially dangerous , this dark <unk> of the idea -- especially in the fact that i was just going to be in my career . </s>
this is -- you see : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old . </s>
i &apos;ve got a little bit more <unk> in me . </s>
and it &apos;s probably a surprise that everything i &apos;m going to be about to write from now than the work of work , which is the work of the work that the work came to my final book , and right ? </s>
i say it <unk> , because we &apos;re all of the kind of friends -- it &apos;s really likely that my biggest success is still alive . </s>
oh jesus , what a thought ! </s>
these are the kind of thoughts that somebody can get to get out of 9 / 7 , they get to drink 9 / 7 , and i want to do this . </s>
i would prefer to do this work i love . </s>
so , how do you know ? </s>
after some of the <unk> seems to me i can write to write a kind of <unk> psychological device . </s>
somehow i have to find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the response to the state . </s>
while i was traveling in the past year for the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , i &apos;ve also tried to find other people &apos;s past , if they can help diagnose and help others to see if they can help diagnose and help with creativity . </s>
so this quest to me and the old rome . </s>
please follow me , because the circle is going to close again . </s>
but in the old days , the people don &apos;t believe that creativity of people , okay ? </s>
they believed that creativity is a kind of <unk> <unk> that made out of an distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown . </s>
the greek <unk> of creativity <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
from socrates , he thought he was believed he would have had a <unk> , who would have been <unk> out of the distant . </s>
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative creative creative creative minds , and a <unk> genius . </s>
this is great . the roman thought was that a genius , especially a particularly individual individual . </s>
they believed that an genius of genius that was kind of <unk> in the kind of thing , was that literally <unk> -- about something like <unk> , the <unk> and the artist &apos;s <unk> -- about something like <unk> , and the artist &apos;s sort of <unk> and the <unk> of work . </s>
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s been the distance that i was talking about -- the psychological level that you protect you from the following of your work . </s>
everybody knows that it &apos;s like this , right ? </s>
artist protocol was to be <unk> , like , for example , for example , for example , to a lot of physical , right ? </s>
if your work was done , you didn &apos;t look anything for you , everybody knows that you had this <unk> genius , that &apos;s helped you . </s>
if your work does -- not entirely mistake , or ? </s>
everybody knew your genius was something that &apos;s fascinating . </s>
so people have really been thinking about creativity , and so people thought in creativity . </s>
and then the renaissance and everything was happening , we changed this big idea -- and this big idea was : let &apos;s not have a human individual to the universe of the universe -- and there &apos;s no room for more than the creatures that are called the orders of the divine . </s>
it &apos;s the beginning of the blind in the blind , and people began to believe that creativity is completely from the world . </s>
for the first time in the history , you hear people , or a artist artist call an genius -- instead of what he has to have an genius . </s>
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake . </s>
you know ? i think , one of the person that he thinks he thinks he or they think he or it was like the <unk> and the <unk> and the source of all , creative , <unk> , is a little bit of a responsibility to a long way to have a little bit more creative creative . </s>
it &apos;s like somebody to swallow someone to swallow . </s>
and so , the first thing , and they distorted , and it creates all these <unk> expectations to the success . </s>
i think that <unk> our artists are the last 500 years of animal . </s>
and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question : it &apos;s the question : is the question : it &apos;s the question . </s>
can we change it ? </s>
perhaps , maybe a <unk> understanding the relationship between people and mystery of creative consent . </s>
maybe not . </s>
maybe we can &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> out of this in a <unk> talk to be a talk of <unk> . </s>
and there are certainly people in this audience , which really <unk> scientific doubt is about the idea of -- -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects . </s>
i &apos;m not going to take on this journey of them . </s>
but the question i want to do is , why not ? </s>
why not that way ? </s>
because it makes quantifying the way everything else i &apos;ve heard , if it was about it , the absolute <unk> of the creative process of life . </s>
so , a process that remember -- how anyone who has ever attempted to do something about -- so in other words , it &apos;s actually always reasonable . </s>
in fact , he can sometimes feel very much about it . </s>
i had a encounter encounter when i was the extraordinary american disabled who was now about 90 , who now was now as they were in the <unk> virginia , she said she was feeling a poem in the <unk> virginia , she said she would feel like a poem about the landscape . </s>
she said it would be like a <unk> train of the air , and she said . </s>
the country on them would be on them . </s>
it felt like when it came to , because it would take the earth under the quake . </s>
she knew that you could do in a moment that you could do in a moment , and this was -- in their words -- <unk> <unk> , like the devil <unk> . </s>
they ran like the devil , for the devil , during the house , because they were tracking by this poem , and it was just about that they had to get a sheet of paper and a pencil so they needed to be able to get a sheet of paper and a pencil so they could grow through them , and then they could go through the sheet of
in other words , they didn &apos;t get fast enough . they ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran it , and they ran into the house and they said -- <unk> <unk> to another poet . </s>
and then there was this moments -- the part i never forgot -- she said that there was a little bit of the world &apos;s almost . </s>
so , she &apos;s looking at the house and they &apos;re walking through paper and the poem she goes through them and they &apos;re going to go through them , and then she said , she said -- was it as if you were , and then she &apos;s going to go back to your other hand , and it was going to end . </s>
she &apos;s floating the poem on its tail , and put it back into her body and put it on the paper . </s>
and so in these <unk> , the poem came to the paper , and she goes on -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first time . </s>
when i was hearing , i thought i was this , which is exactly what my creative process is doing . </s>
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the canal ! </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> . i have to work with each day at the same time , and sweat , and sweat , and i &apos;m really <unk> <unk> and really awkward . </s>
but even in my <unk> , sometimes this thing is <unk> . </s>
and i guess that many of you have done this . </s>
even i had been working or ideas that i could not identify about a source of a source of <unk> that i really couldn &apos;t identify . </s>
what &apos;s this for a thing ? </s>
and how do we lose to our minds with this information , but we lose in the contrary to keep in the opposite of our health ? </s>
for me , the best example of the way you can do this , how do you create this , the musician tom <unk> , i was allowed to put it in a few years ago . </s>
we talked about this issue . and you know what ? the most of his life was tom , the <unk> of the modern artist , who was trying to make these <unk> creative heritage , who was trying to get these <unk> creative heritage that could be able to dominate and with them . </s>
but then he became older and forth , and he told me that he was a <unk> in los angeles , and there &apos;s changed everything for him . </s>
he was entering a high speed when he suddenly suddenly just a little fragment of a tune , which is , as it &apos;s about a <unk> fragment , and it wants you to go , and it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> , but he can &apos;t use it . </s>
he didn &apos;t have any piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t stand , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> . </s>
so he starts looking at these old <unk> in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be thrown out of this song . </s>
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t own . &quot; </s>
but instead of panic , he stopped on it . </s>
he was running the whole <unk> and <unk> something completely . </s>
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; <unk> , can you not see that i &apos;m going to pay attention ? </s>
<unk> is so much like to do this , i could actually do a song ? </s>
if you really want to go , come back to a <unk> moment if i can take you . </s>
if not , <unk> , somebody else &apos;s somebody else &apos;s day . </s>
go and cohen cohen cohen cohen . </s>
his entire <unk> has changed . </s>
not the work itself . it was such dark as it was , and the ones . </s>
but the process and heavy metals , the heavy <unk> , which is described when he was the genius of the <unk> , and it &apos;s where he was going to sort of , as a <unk> , and he &apos;s going to sort of <unk> where he was , he had to be able to do it . </s>
it could be a <unk> , surprising , <unk> collaboration between tom and the <unk> , which is not entirely . </s>
when i heard this story , it was also a bit of the kind of like i worked and i &apos;ve been humbled me . </s>
this idea of <unk> me as i was in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , love was a disaster , and i fell into one of these clips that was going to be a disaster , and you &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s being a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book that ever written . </s>
not just bad , but the worst of all time . </s>
i started thinking , i should just put the project . </s>
but then i remembered how tom in the <unk> was spoken , and i was trying to figure it . </s>
so i was going off the manuscript , and i was going to go back into a blank corner of space . </s>
i &apos;m talking about <unk> , you know , you know , and i &apos;m going to be , if this book isn &apos;t completely brilliant , it &apos;s completely blame , right ? </s>
because you know , i &apos;ve all everything i have , i &apos;m making , i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t have more than that . </s>
so if you want to have a long , you have to get some quick and your stake &apos;s common . </s>
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know , then the devil it is that it &apos;s going to go . </s>
i &apos;m going to write on behalf , because that &apos;s my job . </s>
and i want to give you to be careful that i was part of the jobs today . </s>
because ... -- it &apos;s like , centuries ago , architect have turned to <unk> people with roman <unk> and music , the hours were brought up -- until the dawn . </s>
these are always amazing because the dancers were professionally and they were fantastic . </s>
but then , very rare , happened something that &apos;s been done by the beginning of the performers . </s>
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve seen a performance of the performance in your life . </s>
it was like the time capsule , and the dancer by a way , he did not unlike it before he did it before he did it before , but all of these things are happening . </s>
and all of a sudden he doesn &apos;t get more human . </s>
it was carried from the inside , and from underneath , and all <unk> <unk> , and all <unk> fire . </s>
as something happened , knew what was that . she called it at his name . </s>
they put together the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god . </s>
that &apos;s god , you know ? </s>
interesting warriors : when the <unk> <unk> were designed to convert this <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is still <unk> and <unk> . </s>
if a leader in spain , something like something like something , something called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> look at god . </s>
and this is great because we need this . </s>
but , the most part of the nearest is the next morning , if the dancer , <unk> , and recognizes that 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday , and he doesn &apos;t mix any <unk> of god . </s>
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe he &apos;ll never know it again . and maybe he &apos;ll never know again . </s>
and you may never start again , if it &apos;s spinning , but what is it going to start with the rest of your life ? </s>
this is hard . </s>
this is one of the most enduring <unk> of a creative life . </s>
but maybe it &apos;s not quite a full sense of being the whole <unk> if you don &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of their own is you &apos;ve been talking about . </s>
if you may think that they are an easy -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time , who are in somebody else , if you &apos;re done with it . </s>
if we start thinking about it , changes everything . </s>
so i started thinking , and so i think , in the past months , i was working on the past months , as i worked on the book , which is soon enough , and then <unk> , who expected my <unk> success . </s>
what i constantly constantly must say about when i &apos;m going to talk about it , i don &apos;t scare . </s>
it &apos;s not like . </s>
do your job . </s>
it &apos;s always the most amazing thing . </s>
if your job is , dance . </s>
if the stupid divine genius , which you want to say , you have to go to the side , you know , for a short moment , then <unk> <unk> , then <unk> <unk> , <unk> ! <unk> ! </s>
and if not , dance , dance , your dance . </s>
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you . </s>
i believe in this , we should teach this . </s>

i &apos;ll start with some simple examples . </s>
this is the <unk> &apos;s for the <unk> <unk> and when i go into a direction , it will roll the video forward , and if i go back to the other direction , it &apos;s backwards . </s>
and these interactive portraits are going to take each other . </s>
so if i put them all side , you &apos;re interested in charge . </s>
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , they &apos;re also going to be nervous . </s>
and they feel their movements and tendency . </s>
and a interesting consequence of interactions that we began to realize that we could use a commitment gestures on data , like the colors of colors , how do you do this with the <unk> . </s>
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to paint it into the middle , where they &apos;re going to grow . </s>
if we overdo it , we can put a little bit more . </s>
there are also some nice opportunity in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we &apos;re spending the opportunity to get the possibility of the fast , and the outputs of the results are going to see . </s>
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series of a fibonacci <unk> . </s>
this is a game that &apos;s a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> . </s>
so basically , you get any round of every square meter , and while you &apos;re trying to go words and say words , will be a <unk> . </s>
then , after about 30 seconds , again , and you have a new trajectory and new possibilities . </s>
thank you . </s>
these are some kids who are heading to a trip to the media lab , i was able to move them , and i took a video of it . </s>
they really loved it . </s>
a interesting fact , in this kind of applications , that you have to be able to have to people in the people . </s>
all you have to say &quot; powers &quot; and you know exactly what to do . </s>
here are some people who test it . </s>
this is our primary <unk> there . </s>
it turned out that he was just going to just stack the <unk> . </s>
so they were just <unk> . </s>
this is a <unk> <unk> . </s>
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s fair . </s>
he can put new characters in the scene using the <unk> off the table of the table that shows this character . </s>
here &apos;s what it lets you look like . </s>
the sun goes on . </s>
now he &apos;s a tractor in the scene . </s>
the orange ones . </s>
good work ! yeah ! </s>
by looking at the <unk> and they can put the characters in the characters -- you can let it flow to the characters . </s>
and ... his own story . </s>
hi ! </s>
it &apos;s a story with a little bit , and he can decide how they co-evolved . </s>
flying cat . </s>
the last example i &apos;ve now is , i &apos;ve now been to show you , is an essential for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently , and we &apos;ve developed as sounds as sounds as sounds , like <unk> , bass and conservation . </s>
every single one has four different variations , you can select what you use . </s>
and you can use this sounds into the sequence of <unk> that you can turn into a desktop . </s>
and you &apos;ll notice it by simply a <unk> , you know , you &apos;re holding a <unk> . </s>
there are effects that you can change live , like the hall and filters . </s>
you take it with a particular tone and then it tends to be able to do it . </s>
and then , as much as actors and the volume that you enjoy the entire sequence . </s>
so let &apos;s look at . </s>
we start where we start the <unk> in two <unk> , and these are a set of social , they &apos;re falling and a little bit more of the voice . </s>
now i add a <unk> . </s>
now i &apos;m going to do something more than to do . </s>
and now i was able to filter the filter with the drums , so that i can control the effect live . </s>
i can measure the whole sequence , by making the pace into a way or another direction . </s>
and now i &apos;m going to put the filter with the bass , for something more expression . </s>
i can reorder the sequence while they &apos;re driving . </s>
so i don &apos;t have to plan it , not in the orphanage , but they &apos;re improvising ; they &apos;re <unk> . </s>
and finally , i can sprinkle the whole sequence by looking at the <unk> to the left . </s>
thank you . </s>
so , as you can see , my excitement is to develop new <unk> that are better to the way our brains and bodies work . </s>
and today , i had time to give you a part of this new <unk> and some of the ways we work in our lab . </s>
the idea that i want to give you to the way , is that we want to be able to be able to be on the brink of <unk> to this new generation of <unk> to the interaction with digital media , the information in our world , the information in our world . </s>
thanks . </s>
i &apos;m looking at the conversations with them ! </s>
yeah , good afternoon . </s>
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there . </s>
yeah , so what should be more ? </s>
i just have to watch a little bit , and it &apos;s busy <unk> with modern-day molecular biology . </s>
i study biology and photographs of me now for several years , and i started thinking about a few years , and i started thinking about , because i was just doing anything , i &apos;ve learned that i learned so in the study . </s>
so , that was my primary motivation . </s>
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to sort of get closer to the matter , so that . </s>
i think the molecular biology are happening throughout the general now , so the whole debate , all of biotechnology , everything you &apos;re doing , synthetic biology and so on , and so on , and so on , and so on , and so on , and so on , and so on , and so on , and so on , and so on , and so
extremely important , now is extremely important and more importantly , much more important will will be . </s>
there &apos;s this mysterious stuff like this all of these <unk> plants , the plants plants on the <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s now craig venter in the <unk> , who &apos;s trying to make <unk> , so the gasoline from algae . </s>
there are things that are totally <unk> in the day-to-day life , which is totally people but not aware of the <unk> that allow us to wash with heart attacks , are also some <unk> enzymes . </s>
and the list can offer over there . </s>
and so from the interest , i &apos;m going to continue there on the technology , i &apos;m going to continue there . </s>
what &apos;s happening now ? </s>
most people know most of the people know what the <unk> . </s>
computer , and then it will always be like , yes , the hackers will break somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere and claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws and the claws
that &apos;s kind of like the <unk> , because this is not what they did , and what &apos;s actually happening behind this . </s>
and this is the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s also emerged in the internet . </s>
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , creative , a problem , a problem . </s>
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a single problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a <unk> , and how can you simplify the different or how things you do that . </s>
and it became , it became , with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that &apos;s also going to do with <unk> all kinds of things . </s>
and now , in the direction , and there &apos;s what i want to do is to be able to find this metaphor that is actually a <unk> because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , so it &apos;s good matter , and not just iridium . </s>
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also programming code and also , you can also hack it , and that &apos;s what i found that i was incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to go through much deeper . </s>
so this really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , that networks , and that &apos;s the networks . </s>
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , that &apos;s originally , that &apos;s a <unk> and with a cooperation in india , and now , on the planet , and now , on the world has to be the world . </s>
so this is a <unk> <unk> , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists and ask with scientists and ask with scientists and ask with scientists and ask with scientists and ask , there is <unk> and yeah , all sorts of things . </s>
but it &apos;s always about making a <unk> of what it is to have a string of a <unk> relationship . </s>
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> . </s>
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more like this kind of forum where you can hold and make it online . </s>
they &apos;re a bit technical , and also a little bit of <unk> , and then they will ask , yeah , yes , yes . </s>
and besides this networks that all of the popular has been made , has evolved so a scene that i &apos;m going to make a very short time . </s>
here &apos;s the image on the top here , this is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , such a private school , the physical physical , and can be a private school , where everybody can . </s>
kids , old people go up to just just a little bit , you have a lab and look at what you can do when these <unk> <unk> . </s>
on the left , on the bottom left is a group in indonesia , <unk> is called the ones that have been a long time . </s>
as a different two networks . </s>
they also have to have a artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , including <unk> , and combine it in a pretty <unk> way . </s>
one of the things that i &apos;ve been in front of a while ago , they &apos;ve met this is a <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> that would like to give you in the public , and they &apos;ve done so on the public , to try and explain to explain what &apos;s going on to explain what &apos;s going on . </s>
and i &apos;ve been up on the other image in copenhagen with a lecture in copenhagen with a show of the subject . </s>
and this is , yeah , this is most often young people , but the only thing that &apos;s really happening is that the thing is actually happening , is this fascination of the technology . </s>
and what you can do with it and also , and also lots of society and ask , like , okay , what do you want to do , what do you want to do , you know , what do you want to do with you ? </s>
so , <unk> , to avoid biology , you don &apos;t need some material . </s>
you need biological materials , and you need biological tools , and that &apos;s a lab . </s>
what you normally do in a lab , which are so kind of <unk> machines , extremely , extremely , extremely , extremely , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , for <unk> , educated academics and so on . </s>
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually don &apos;t have to do that . </s>
this is actually not necessary because every single collective has actually shifted that technology when most of the <unk> , that &apos;s really . </s>
and so , in the process of this premise , then for instance , brian <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , has a <unk> and a <unk> , and it has a <unk> , a <unk> and , yeah , <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be bacteria . </s>
so every one that &apos;s been a <unk> <unk> , which he &apos;s too long , and has been a long time ago . </s>
i just tried this in my lab , a little , and then you end up with the ebay and then i could put a little baby analysis , trying to make a little baby analysis , so that &apos;s how much <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to happen . </s>
now this should not be a joke , but it should be . </s>
here in the picture , you see , is the lab , the lab , in <unk> , so that &apos;s a <unk> garage , and also quite a pretty interesting thing to do is to do quite a <unk> garage , and also , i want to do a project for a project . </s>
and this is <unk> , who also mentioned , this is kind of <unk> , this is kind of <unk> in molecular biology . </s>
and yeah , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s relatively <unk> that are there , that &apos;s kind of people who are going to be able to do that for the fact that the oceans will take over the oceans , until the fact that you have even a lot more <unk> in <unk> form . </s>
but whenever it &apos;s always the idea that it &apos;s just easy to be easy . </s>
the first project we have done as a international group , when we were unaware of our own , <unk> , there are now as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know it , and we know the people that are going to be and so forth . </s>
and then , by the <unk> <unk> website , the founder of the founders , and we &apos;ve got to really have been told , we &apos;ve also got to really meet ourselves , and then two events , and then you &apos;ve got to be 10 to the <unk> , san francisco . </s>
and , there &apos;s a point about what we want , what do we want to do what do we want to do , what do we want to do ? </s>
and what are our values and what is our energy , our foundations ? </s>
and then we &apos;ve been doing this , we have a <unk> . </s>
this was the right , so everyone has just his desires , his and what it is moved , expressed , then . </s>
there &apos;s been a very good code , and i think , a very good code . </s>
and we have this idea of the idea of not collapse , but this is , i think , is relatively well , are relatively good , people are quite passionate about this . </s>
and we even trying to do this in the academic world , but there &apos;s kind of not as much as it is . </s>
so i think we &apos;re out of the <unk> , in terms of the way even the world &apos;s way , but a step further than the world . </s>
what do we do that , for projects , we do ? </s>
and a project i did was that i did with the <unk> , was that we did a <unk> trillion or optical <unk> . </s>
this is when you focus on a beam , you can use a beam of particles , you can use little particles particles in the air and then in this focus , so that &apos;s where the <unk> and then in this focus , that &apos;s the end , so like this kind of polishing in the principle . </s>
this works really , that &apos;s going to be in academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , that would be a webcam , the lens , the lens , the lens , you have a microscope , and then you have a microscope , which is going to be about <unk> . </s>
this is what you see . </s>
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and then try to create the laser <unk> and then try to focus on this camera . </s>
and that &apos;s not true , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of things . </s>
so another project that comes from the french group , which has been a pretty cool project , which has been pretty cool . </s>
and it &apos;s like this , it &apos;s like , you know , such a <unk> , so <unk> or something , so he &apos;s got to be engaged with <unk> , his <unk> is sam . </s>
he &apos;s got this place here , and in cooperation , with the museum , that &apos;s what &apos;s happened . </s>
and then there was the visitors in the room , looking at this chair , looking at this place , that helmet is a very helmet . </s>
then they got their brainwaves , and depending on what they thought they &apos;d thought or how they thought is then different lights in the room . </s>
it was pretty much more substantial . </s>
another thing from the united states , that &apos;s also being able to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , the <unk> , complicated word . </s>
so it &apos;s about trying to copy genes , to replicate , <unk> , building , fragments , to build fragments , so you can make them visible . </s>
so if i do this , the <unk> , the crime , then you go , collect any <unk> , and then they can say that they can say this method , and then they can say , <unk> , that &apos;s the hair , to this hair . </s>
and the machines that are quite expensive , which are quite expensive that you &apos;re capable of building the commercially , the cheapest , go to the <unk> . </s>
and this is not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also really do much . </s>
so this is just a application of many that you can do with it . </s>
and they have two two of the <unk> and said , <unk> , and then we have a simple and cheap , and then they &apos;re <unk> , and then they &apos;re <unk> , and then they &apos;re the cheapest , and they &apos;re the cheapest flow of these devices . </s>
i think , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely on every case , where it &apos;s going to be greatly clear . </s>
so it &apos;s my mind , looking for a very depressing hack . </s>
a project i had had to build a <unk> . </s>
<unk> , yeah , like a kind of <unk> , which is that it &apos;s about two or so far . </s>
you put <unk> on <unk> and then the <unk> into these <unk> , and then i tested the end , and then i tested the <unk> and then bring it to the way that it will end with it . </s>
so the device that you see , that &apos;s not working . </s>
but this is so my prototype , but rather than my prototype , so on this kind of branch , the thing on , electronics , and pressure , and that was the pressure was too high , and that &apos;s the pressure to high , the thing is broken . </s>
and then i took a <unk> and put it up . </s>
a <unk> , if you take the full power of water , it has enough pressure , so i think , as fast as five to <unk> <unk> . </s>
and so you can then take the particles of the speed of speed and then go into the battlefield . </s>
and the commercial device costs about <unk> dollars or something like this , <unk> , so you can go through . </s>
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible . </s>
so , that &apos;s the most part of the scene of the scene , that availability of technologies and also the information and information and information to increase that more people can engage . </s>
because , as i said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little hunch of it , and also , really good . </s>
because if you read it about it , from <unk> , which is not the same as if you did it yourself or seen it yourself . </s>
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies . </s>
and if you want to be a citizen citizen , you need to make a difference in society , and can &apos;t want to be able to talk , then you need access to knowledge and technology . </s>
and you have to understand it and understand it to understand . </s>
and then under the <unk> open source and <unk> science . </s>
so that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to get it to these scientific technologies . </s>
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
these are the people who are at least in the website , <unk> website . </s>
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world . </s>
and interesting is that they are represented in asia . </s>
that &apos;s what i think they &apos;re less people , as a way , in fact , less than actually . </s>
so i know some of those who don &apos;t have . </s>
and this is just the <unk> , the individual people . </s>
partly with these <unk> , so that &apos;s this middle of the world combined there . </s>
and that &apos;s all the beginning . </s>
as i said , <unk> has been going . </s>
and <unk> , the <unk> , because the <unk> was the first , <unk> . </s>
and this is a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> , who are all over the world . </s>
and we hope we &apos;re hoping that we &apos;re also connected to be also more likely to be <unk> , and then we also have good connected to the extent that even more people can be involved . </s>
and i would invite everybody , so it &apos;s too heavy and even try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try
it &apos;s not as simple , but it &apos;s not impossible to be able to be there , if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there too far . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
that &apos;s it . </s>
yeah , hey . </s>
how do we work people ? </s>
this is a question that worries me is that i was really moved as a designer , but also in the <unk> <unk> and most of all things in the domain <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s about how to people in the interactive media , so they can use these interactive media and make it to make it more precise experience . </s>
i think the interactive media in us , cognitive models , cognitive models , so paradigm , that in our biological memory , is very long , very long time , and we can apply the <unk> media . </s>
and this is very amazing because you think that this <unk> that you believe that these <unk> that you &apos;re going to find , that the one is actually going into the future , but actually , it &apos;s so that the future is right in our <unk> . </s>
what are now right now ? </s>
i &apos;ll just want to talk about four <unk> , and i want to explain to quickly . </s>
and to <unk> <unk> and the models that we have in the modern times of the modern times . </s>
so , at these <unk> models , we have a prime relationship on natural power to the paths . </s>
this is what &apos;s called unusual . </s>
i &apos;m going to get up to the same time , and i &apos;ll prove you prove that they also have a natural relationship on the mine . </s>
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been since due to this <unk> models that &apos;s able to talk very , very , very , very , very , very , very well , although we &apos;re using a <unk> language . </s>
and the third section is about itself . </s>
we all know that the interactive media is designed to definition , what the denial of the linearity is , and what tells us that we &apos;re learning as a normal feel . </s>
the fourth thing is that the history of us is a place for us . </s>
how is this with the power of the virtuality , which is actually the most disastrous thing in the world . </s>
i want to prove this to you . </s>
how many who have been the house in which they live ? </s>
so that &apos;s not going to be instantly going to be going to be going to answer , but it &apos;s going to happen and see it right now . </s>
they go through this house , in <unk> , they live , and look at how many doors there are . </s>
and that &apos;s what they do . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> the reality and it &apos;s not without computers . </s>
it &apos;s fantastic ? </s>
and we &apos;re going to give you a way of the <unk> , virtual reality , virtual reality , we can actually see this all the time . </s>
and this is the one that allowed to be the virtual reality that people have had to people in the process of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the time that people had nothing . </s>
no books we have no books . </s>
or they didn &apos;t have a <unk> . </s>
they didn &apos;t plan . </s>
the only thing that had been head . </s>
and in this head playing the memory of the memory . </s>
in this head , <unk> and the <unk> of these virtual pictures , the world , became aware of the imagination . </s>
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can &apos;t deal with the power of the virtuality . </s>
the interesting thing about that if i &apos;m going to make a little trip . </s>
yeah , this is going . </s>
the interesting thing about this is that time of the human ingenuity and medium . </s>
now , if you think about a little more time . </s>
what are media ? </s>
then they will notice that it has a change . </s>
but i &apos;ll just talk to the same again . </s>
separate levels of the <unk> are <unk> for the most of the <unk> . </s>
<unk> , priests , so-called <unk> , and they were getting <unk> to maintain knowledge . </s>
and today we &apos;re now going to have very much more about stories . </s>
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , studied <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> hours of stories . </s>
this is a kid that &apos;s going to reach out of the most <unk> history of the most <unk> offenders , and most of the <unk> spent the time of stories . </s>
now , think of our love of all , we think we &apos;re talking about as a kid on the lap of our parents . </s>
no , far north , no , far . </s>
this is a lot of the other way back to the cultures of the <unk> . </s>
but in the field of the interactive media , as a particularly impressive media is about to be in our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think . </s>
i have a <unk> of the african tribe tribe , which is <unk> tribe . </s>
and the lives lived in british columbia . </s>
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very basic zone , and you had to get some kind of computer to get out of island to island food . </s>
and they did this with something called <unk> . </s>
you know , this is what you might know if you &apos;re a little bit about it , from the australian australian . </s>
they have similar principles . </s>
they don &apos;t have any <unk> , but they have the <unk> <unk> of <unk> . </s>
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions of regions of regions of regions . </s>
where the language of <unk> was <unk> . </s>
that means you &apos;re going to be about sounds and rhythm . </s>
and these sounds and these rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and also it also makes sense that you could <unk> these songs and different and move back to the left , and again , back to the right . </s>
why do we sing to get from a person &apos;s from a <unk> ? </s>
not to navigate in the future . </s>
what &apos;s happening in there ? </s>
what happens is that <unk> <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ve been talking about it before , in the so-called <unk> . </s>
what happens is that the image and what happened is the book and what happened is the most <unk> . </s>
and that &apos;s what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the ones that have the own production of our individual memories , in response , in response . </s>
and on the book , and on the image . </s>
so we &apos;ve got a <unk> piece of <unk> <unk> . </s>
and the popular power is <unk> for us , and has nothing to do with reality . </s>
bruce brown , a well-known <unk> to the <unk> , is so far on the <unk> , is so far on the <unk> , is so far on the television , and so on what we call this as a mass of the world today and so on , and our capacity to <unk> <unk> . </s>
let &apos;s make a little <unk> . </s>
from the <unk> for the days . </s>
what has beyond our thinking about our thinking and on our <unk> ? </s>
then they are the most pessimistic <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
and they &apos;re going to be the course of centuries and more <unk> , by the <unk> of the owner . </s>
that means we have to individually individually , we have a long way to spread , in masses , patterns of memories we can depend on the other memories . </s>
we produce not producing more . </s>
we have a abstract language , language . </s>
we don &apos;t ask that to pictures that stuff are not in pictures , but we &apos;re going to put it yourself . </s>
we used to be used to all happen , things happen . </s>
and we &apos;ve been the linearity as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the <unk> . </s>
what &apos;s wrong is the <unk> . </s>
still , in fact , we &apos;re more than <unk> , very strong . </s>
the question is , what is it right ? </s>
we had the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve had the same thing , and we &apos;re going to take this as a result of this . </s>
that sounds very <unk> and sounds very much , i know . </s>
but these concepts of the <unk> that bring us to uncover us back to their capabilities back to their abilities . </s>
there &apos;s about hot , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about high-capacity <unk> . </s>
i want to explain a little bit about it . </s>
there are leaders concepts like the <unk> , that means extended reality . </s>
so , google <unk> , you know , then , then , is that concept of what makes us virtual world with the real world , that means our <unk> to <unk> , the virtual thing is normal , that &apos;s virtual than something like that , natural , it &apos;s going to be brought back to the natural world . </s>
another example is so virtual reality . </s>
so crazy in the context of my talk , we &apos;re moving physically physically , virtual worlds , virtual worlds , the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
and other example are the <unk> , smart systems . </s>
these are spaces that are smart to a human being . </s>
all of the ability to accept our basic ability to accept the real ability to accept the real habitat . </s>
i &apos;ve been in the <unk> and i hope that video works , a very beautiful project , that &apos;s the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . </s>
and the two are <unk> are now . </s>
maybe you can get your briefly pouring , so she &apos;s pouring in recess with the two of the project . </s>
and this project i have , as a example , as again , in this <unk> , cognitive models . </s>
this is a game i have to say to say . </s>
what &apos;s called the <unk> of course , and it &apos;s a computer computer . </s>
and when i say you , you have a very unlikely one or any people ago , or they &apos;re going to play with some of the other <unk> in your hand . </s>
anyway , they do that in the right . </s>
this is a game for the outside . </s>
and that &apos;s what i thought is that i &apos;m going to do the outside world , so i &apos;m going to do the real world . </s>
and this game , the virtual world , the data that data the <unk> , which we produce , the data that we produce , with the real world . </s>
i apologize that i have to die so hard . </s>
you can see much better than there &apos;s much better than more than more . </s>
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to see is that i &apos;ve got a city by looking at what the locations was positive or negative . </s>
and so i &apos;m from the city of the city , a very different impression , i &apos;m looking at negative and positive <unk> , a very different artist and a way , a very different way , virtual map of a very real city . </s>
and we can look at the same time . </s>
ah , what you see , sorry , is a little bit of what you see . </s>
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities , is clear . </s>
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make this virtual worlds . </s>
so i loved that , my talk and is in the sense that the properties and skills that we &apos;ve made out of the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;ve been going to be in the way that we &apos;ve made out of the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;ve been going to be in the way that we &apos;ve made out of the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;ve
thank you . </s>
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be being being being being . </s>
i was asked whether this bag is a <unk> bag , and i can talk to my rather than rather than a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s not going to do it . </s>
i &apos;m going to get a moment in what &apos;s in there . </s>
but i do it just a little bit curious about it . </s>
yeah , kids are from the nature of curious or should be curious , designer . </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> of house , so i &apos;ve got to fill myself to the subject of curiosity and how about the curiosity again , our thinking , and why we lose curiosity and then lose curiosity and so on . </s>
this is a whole range of things that you have to be engaged in the <unk> of the <unk> as a creator . </s>
if professors are going to be , they &apos;re often going to be frequent in such an n <unk> . </s>
and this is also what i had last year , that i had last year . </s>
a <unk> for the subject of the <unk> design </s>
now , why are you going to ask , why are all the payoff of the world &apos;s own , <unk> <unk> of communication , and so on . </s>
and i think one of these little devices , the things always always become more morally , and you need to see what &apos;s going to be always more for us , of course , and then you need to see what &apos;s <unk> or intuitive . </s>
and before the background , i &apos;ve been discussing to the area of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field , so the next generation of the
so i &apos;ve been to go through when i was , or a <unk> . </s>
also maybe again , you might look behind . </s>
why does this happen ? </s>
so if we look at the evolution of our society , this is where i &apos;m short , we &apos;re now talking about the third of the third , and we &apos;re going to <unk> . </s>
so from the modern line . </s>
each of the society is shaped by a <unk> . </s>
at the beginning of the language . </s>
that means you &apos;ve found that you could have a common language , you could have a common cave or other areas , has been educated , has raised cities &apos; or <unk> and <unk> <unk> . </s>
the <unk> was , something very natural , something very natural , something very natural . </s>
now , you had to learn , so no can &apos;t distinguish any of the toddler , but we learn it to be <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and this was then <unk> through the ancient society , and the first shape of the abstraction . </s>
this was a <unk> because , of course , the <unk> language began to decay in the form of writing that means what is <unk> and alive , i &apos;m going to go and <unk> it into rock and so i do it . </s>
depending on the day like i <unk> and when i &apos;m <unk> , it &apos;s another thing that &apos;s one thing about , of course , when it &apos;s a close to a alive . </s>
but then , <unk> moved to this script , the script , the founder of mind . </s>
then next generation , we actually live in today , live , live . </s>
this is pressure through pressure and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and others . </s>
the time , the same thing is just a <unk> , where king , <unk> and other people , are you really insanely , if the people starts to read the people , then they want to read the third , and that &apos;s totally <unk> . </s>
and now we &apos;re really coming into the next generation and the <unk> , so that &apos;s just a <unk> , and we &apos;re really at this moment in this very particular stage , that we are going to join in . </s>
the reason we &apos;re all told us because we see the new media , <unk> social media and so on . </s>
with the total transparency , what &apos;s going to think about the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> <unk> , and no longer have more or other phenomena , that i want to hear this , and i want to do this . </s>
and these two worlds are just going together , new and old thinking . </s>
the exciting thing about that if you think about the core , these <unk> , these <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
now not that &apos;s on the local level , but on global scale . </s>
we have understood that the weather is global . </s>
that &apos;s a global global thing . </s>
not even if i think there &apos;s ecologically , thinking , and the neighbor is less , it works less ecologically , then it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
that means that &apos;s from the local village , a global village is actually a global village , and of course , the <unk> , but also the total transparency . </s>
as you know , in the village , who knew who has known to whom and when it &apos;s about this expansion of our <unk> , on global scale . </s>
it &apos;s that we know , global , and always and better . </s>
as it used to be the last thing on the village . </s>
before the background , i &apos;ve been looking at busy busy about what is it , because what &apos;s going on , of course , what &apos;s going on , of course , what makes us also , of course , what makes the difference ? </s>
because often , people can &apos;t do it with it , so everybody can circumvent it . </s>
so you have to deal with it , what does it mean , and not just change it , it &apos;s different , but it should be also going to be better . </s>
and when of course , of course , a little bit of a positive and how i can do as a mysterious person , and they &apos;re doing things that are so designing the things that they &apos;re doing a <unk> , so they &apos;re just going to be fun and just go . </s>
you &apos;re busy , even during the brain , with the subject of perception and the <unk> . </s>
and this is what you &apos;re going to do , and then you start and <unk> and says , okay , now i &apos;m going to look at the inside of the inner self . </s>
and how does it actually look like this ? </s>
so how do we work when we &apos;re going to <unk> ? </s>
and what does it mean , of course , and how do our channels of perception and how does our cognitive channels of perception and how does the cognitive processing ? </s>
because steve jobs has said , &quot; you <unk> your <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
so you have to really take something more mature , if i want to do something more or a thousand <unk> , what is that in the core . </s>
and there &apos;s a sense that you &apos;re a great senses , most of you think , most of you think about five , are now in the middle of the time , the next point , it &apos;s going to happen again , and as a state again . </s>
and to look at how we are information to how we are information ? </s>
what &apos;s information ? </s>
information is a difference that makes a difference . </s>
many use of the word , but not what it means like it means . </s>
but i have to understand , in the core , in the creatures , when is going to be information to information , when are the world &apos;s data , and from information , i know how i can get after the other person , or any way i can do . </s>
and of course , how does it affect the perception . </s>
so we see this , if i think things are you , i can &apos;t catch you , i can look at them , like , what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i &apos;m able to make a intuitive , i &apos;m going to show you . </s>
so a lot of natural , but i see this way , and i see this way , where is salt and pepper in it . </s>
and if i say somebody &apos;s salt , or pepper , then he &apos;s going to be thinking , is going to be thinking , where is it . </s>
and then , the left just come up and then hopefully that no sugar is in there , the salt of salt . </s>
but also our perception of how they do it affects us . </s>
for example , these perception are in the context . </s>
the right is bigger than the little , although that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re very large , and yet changing our perception , depending on what context we do things . </s>
anyone know what that is ? </s>
<unk> <unk> . </s>
<unk> <unk> should work . </s>
and there &apos;s been more likely to be more like my glasses . </s>
so it &apos;s n circle . </s>
a second circle has been studying similarity , or <unk> . </s>
and then i &apos;m going to see you , you see , we see not only one entity , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a unit , we don &apos;t see a unit , a circle , a circle of a circle . </s>
there &apos;s something called <unk> or <unk> , which gives us on cognition . </s>
the important thing for the world , the <unk> , the great <unk> of time . </s>
<unk> <unk> , the continuity of continuity and so on . </s>
and then i forgot back to the third . </s>
but that &apos;s a very bad important thing , if you &apos;re doing things , but you &apos;re also trying to create a intuitively . </s>
the next phenomenon , what &apos;s very interesting about the end . </s>
sounds completely trivial , but it &apos;s really exciting if you &apos;re supposed to be closer with it . </s>
so we have the eyes and now think we see from the beginning to the back . </s>
this is wrong . </s>
and you see from behind the front of the front . </s>
and they &apos;re <unk> a presumption to the front of that , you see something that you &apos;re going to do something about it . </s>
that means we just see our vision before we see it , again , back backwards in our <unk> , to say , in our <unk> , to say , okay , okay , okay , okay . </s>
i &apos;ve got a cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you see . </s>
and that &apos;s also there , this is coming back again . </s>
then it goes forward , because the back <unk> the front is not and say , now , now what you &apos;re going to see , but i &apos;m sure that what you see , that &apos;s what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see . </s>
and then it goes backwards , and then it just &apos;s just like to be seen . </s>
so , very , very much more inclusive process , like certain things are doing and in the <unk> of these things . </s>
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture . </s>
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i described to . </s>
now everybody is trying to recognize something that is happening . </s>
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to . </s>
somebody else &apos;s specific ? </s>
a <unk> , right . </s>
if i saw that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , then they know that . </s>
you &apos;ll never forget that , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is . </s>
now , you see the <unk> . </s>
and then on the other day , they &apos;re always going to be . </s>
this is , i &apos;ve actually been to talk to what you &apos;re going to see , they don &apos;t realize that they don &apos;t realize anymore , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> within a dog within the shortest view , and over again , this dog &apos;s going to see in this <unk> . </s>
and this is this projection of the light , <unk> , vision . </s>
now i know i and now i &apos;m going to go back to the front of that i see the <unk> . </s>
i see the <unk> . </s>
so , very exciting processes that then in this , yes , it &apos;s not , but here in this <unk> crowd , there &apos;s a <unk> mass . </s>
anyone know what three seconds are ? </s>
long , yeah . </s>
this is our present . </s>
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer . </s>
if i know , i know something three seconds , until i sort of like the present into the <unk> , then i can also really really really well <unk> the <unk> of the way i want to leave him by letting someone with three seconds . </s>
it has to be played as a present . </s>
then it moves into the past , and so i can &apos;t get very elegant <unk> for instance , if i know this phenomena . </s>
what &apos;s going to do ? </s>
yeah , milliseconds . </s>
and also a very exciting phenomena . </s>
this is the time that you love in love with it . </s>
that means , if you know that , look at how long , i &apos;m going to see how long , because i don &apos;t have a <unk> for what else then can happen . </s>
and <unk> milliseconds , also a whole thing . </s>
that &apos;s the most period of most of the world we have . </s>
this is happening in a certain sense , as we perceive things . </s>
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re exploring with our environment , so that we can think that . </s>
and needless to be the payoff of the country , and neural pathways or <unk> , but the amount of course , the course of the subject of the fittest . </s>
so , like a human being , accordingly , like this . </s>
there &apos;s actually <unk> the practical functions , so <unk> aspects of these things , or <unk> . </s>
there are <unk> , where i know exactly where i have to do it . </s>
but there are also symbolic functions , why are somebody for so much as a little bit of <unk> , where the <unk> is barely about what <unk> , so <unk> <unk> , although it doesn &apos;t happen ? </s>
there are we more of the <unk> , on the <unk> , we have to deal with it as a world of course . </s>
back to my actual life , the natural interface and subject , what &apos;s natural <unk> , which is <unk> . </s>
<unk> means always like , i can quickly do a certain goal , or how can a users , <unk> cycle of <unk> foods , and it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> a goal . </s>
so , it &apos;s more likely to tell you . </s>
how can i do anything to do something ? </s>
i can &apos;t go directly or i need &apos; n , or i need to have an amazing thing to do . </s>
and less <unk> or <unk> is it . </s>
i just want to just make this very different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better . </s>
that &apos;s what you have to understand . </s>
and then as you get the software that we &apos;ve seen on , then you can also understand why <unk> percent of our modern today , even though it &apos;s more comfortable , even though it &apos;s more central than classical software . </s>
so , intuitive <unk> is not just for apple , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , when i want to share technological devices that people would do . </s>
why ? </s>
because in the rule , we &apos;re going through this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user <unk> , for example , five times faster in our goal . </s>
you have to imagine that if you &apos;re doing something like the classic slope , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , only one hour . </s>
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re going to go through four hours more than you go home , but your employers or a way he &apos;s going to have a corresponding way to deal with the four hours . </s>
but i want to say that it &apos;s for us to do is to do things like that , for us . </s>
if we go back into the field of software , this is where the first <unk> is <unk> , which is very abstract , where you have months to deal with these systems . </s>
then the next thing that already already have been talking about &quot; president <unk> or mental model like the software <unk> , have been , you would have an idea of something that metaphor is a desktop to make the computer code . </s>
so no longer zeros and zeros code , but it &apos;s a metaphor . </s>
this made a lot better , but it &apos;s also much better . </s>
the next generation of the <unk> is already a lot more with behavior . </s>
so i think as a very <unk> very , very much more often than that . </s>
that &apos;s also a paradigm . </s>
i &apos;m going to look at once , the <unk> is going to be a <unk> . </s>
and then i &apos;ve got one step into these natural user interfaces where i &apos;m talking about voice , of language , of language , by gps , <unk> , and not more of the mouse , then i &apos;m still going to go faster and end . </s>
that leads to the point where they are going to be when things are actually more intuitive ? </s>
if you &apos;re going to get wealthier , and then i have to my little friend here and see what does that mean , what does that mean , is that you &apos;re really going to do something too much about is now really a <unk> ? </s>
and that &apos;s always human beings , is always a <unk> , if i have to think about it . </s>
so , not like , he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s just making it . </s>
the less more intuitive , the more intuitive is it . </s>
and what does that mean for designers ? </s>
so , if we look at the time we look at some other , for example , for example , the metaphor , then i can do that . </s>
this is , i can use this intuitive , human <unk> to a software and make the software greatly <unk> . </s>
well , of course , what is really so much about the <unk> of humans and now i &apos;ve seen it . </s>
this is the so-called <unk> . </s>
each of us and <unk> is a constant , and it &apos;s for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
all that makes everybody &apos;s all over time , but he &apos;s doing it unconsciously , and it &apos;s a intuitive or partly . </s>
so the model is already <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in a world , and then all the time we &apos;ve been learning from all of us , without knowing that this model is there . </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is going to be about fifty to <unk> , so in the world , you have found that there &apos;s less frequent <unk> than a day . </s>
i can now cut this mental <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
and by this kind of the transmission , similarly , as the metaphor of the <unk> , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor is a metaphor , a metaphor , a metaphor , a metaphor , a metaphor . </s>
and this is on a higher that &apos;s higher than the average of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> . </s>
and if i &apos;m going to <unk> this , for example , for example , when i was <unk> <unk> , <unk> , as an artist , <unk> , as an selection , it &apos;s a big , i can send that or you send it out , and yes , <unk> , i can send that or shop or shop and so on , i can send that on
then i can translate this . </s>
i &apos;m trying to turn the <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ve been eating every cake . </s>
i was , now i &apos;m going to talk to the object , can <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ll get the whole data , now that can be able to be able to communicate and say , just all of me , let me just take it all of the things . </s>
and on a interface , which means much more intuitive and very much natural . </s>
because i &apos;m going to reach the things that can be appropriate , and they &apos;re going to come up with me , is much more natural than <unk> drugs or other kinds of things that can do things to do . </s>
so , by a way , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i want to close to the end , a and trying to give the hint of the hint of the hint of the hint of the way , and thank you right now for your attention and please . </s>
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity . </s>
the first one , if you &apos;re going to be a child , as a baby , is that they care about what they have to be described , yes , in the <unk> , the more or less , the more or less , the more or less , is , you &apos;ll have to go your curiosity , of course , is going to be , for your
and the curiosity don &apos;t learn to learn . </s>
so , all of those are all that are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn . </s>
i &apos;m going to go to virtually this whole monastery , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> years of <unk> , in quality . </s>
and there &apos;s a central thing . </s>
and the thing about phosphorus . </s>
<unk> <unk> is a chance . </s>
they give you some day , they give you about two grams , and every single day , you have to look at two gram of phosphorus . </s>
you can &apos;t have teeth . </s>
they can &apos;t store energy . </s>
they can &apos;t have any bones . </s>
we could just <unk> the <unk> <unk> . </s>
if we did not go in the test , and it &apos;s not going to happen . </s>
it &apos;s like that we &apos;re going to be a little bit about what was really bad , but it &apos;s not that . </s>
because all of us talking about energy , but no one talks about the <unk> . </s>
the <unk> is much more critical . </s>
we depend on two countries . </s>
we &apos;ve just been spending only for two years , and now , by the <unk> , over the world &apos;s point in the environment worldwide more , than all of these oil spills is being used in all . </s>
in the last two years , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the fields were discarded in germany . </s>
and we take everything . </s>
it makes kids in children . </s>
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little less harmful . </s>
so , for example , the environment , the environment , actually , is actually less . </s>
<unk> the environment , making less junk . </s>
<unk> are less energy , <unk> less energy . </s>
but that &apos;s not protection . </s>
that &apos;s like when i would say , your child , even for three times five times . </s>
that &apos;s just a little less destruction . </s>
if we had to think that from the <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;ll have our entire earth or later a group . </s>
so that &apos;s why the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> . </s>
and the most important thing is we look at the ground as a <unk> . </s>
in the ground , over the bottom of the <unk> . </s>
at the moment , we &apos;re going to build corn corn and lose between 11 and 30 thousand dollars a hectare , or on the square meter . </s>
this is , we lose about the more perfect times more than new being . </s>
we can take the <unk> ratio . </s>
and all of it is packaging or content . </s>
for example , in the <unk> twenty percent of the <unk> are being <unk> . </s>
and because we &apos;re older , that &apos;s the ones that are bigger . </s>
this is all sort of like all in the <unk> . </s>
yeah ? </s>
a baby needs to be a baby . </s>
we could reduce the course of 10 percent , but what does that mean ? </s>
this is going to china in china in a second . </s>
that &apos;s completely trivial . </s>
so , the question is , how do we deal with these guys ? </s>
here &apos;s a proof that men are not pigs . </s>
i want to tell you . </s>
because the phosphorus is going to be <unk> , because the phosphorus is <unk> . </s>
people are going to talk about the urine . </s>
yeah . </s>
so , you can &apos;t be pigs . </s>
because this is it with it , right ? </s>
traditionally , we &apos;re too many in the world . </s>
and if you tell the people who are <unk> , if you say , you know , that would be better , you will not get you , then they &apos;ll be <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and so somebody tells someone like al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing more than the human population . </s>
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;ll miss the earth . </s>
here &apos;s what you ever get more , the better . </s>
yeah . </s>
the first question is we &apos;re really too many ? </s>
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then weigh the ants around four times more than humans . </s>
i could also use termites , but in the united states , there &apos;s no one in the united states , and in so far as they are . </s>
that means ants are much more than we are . </s>
and because they &apos;re physically working much tougher than we and because they only have three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the upper weight , in the upper people in their weight . </s>
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ? </s>
and where you see how far we are , what we really wanted to do , and we could reach , and how sad we could reach on earth , and how sad we could be a program , to <unk> , and how sad we would like to be <unk> , yeah ? </s>
you can &apos;t be just <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ? </s>
the only one . </s>
did you see a <unk> tree ? </s>
yeah ? </s>
one ? </s>
that means that our whole intelligence means that we want to be more than trees , yes ? </s>
yeah ? </s>
no tree is <unk> . </s>
well , you know , it &apos;s ? </s>
there &apos;s no <unk> on trees . </s>
there are all over the remaining season , in the entire time , in the entire time , in the air force . </s>
that you &apos;ve heard about <unk> from trees ? </s>
so , all our intelligence means that we want to be more than trees . </s>
and where you see , even in something like the <unk> <unk> , not that our own <unk> counterparts . </s>
each year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really ought to be in the peer-reviewed . </s>
and we &apos;re too many . </s>
alone . </s>
so we &apos;re feeling guilty of the earth &apos;s earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> and how they all say that our own <unk> . </s>
isn &apos;t that ? </s>
so we &apos;re too many . </s>
it &apos;s certainly to be less harmful , which is <unk> . </s>
but where are we useful ? </s>
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about making a big footprint , the useful is useful . </s>
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , is the highest thing , not being there , yeah ? </s>
<unk> , yeah ? </s>
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there . </s>
even if you would have a lot of them , they would have emissions . </s>
so they can &apos;t solve this . </s>
we can do it . </s>
we can &apos;t retain our nutrients . </s>
we &apos;re going to do in brazil where we have the nutrients &apos;s nutrients . </s>
right now , we can apply that way to agriculture in agriculture . </s>
we do this in china , where we take them directly to take directly the <unk> . </s>
in china , a <unk> magnitude , is , say , yeah ? </s>
and in our western world , we were always able to predict our nutrients . </s>
that means that entire western <unk> is that the city always has just taken , but the farmers have never been colonized . </s>
and so , the cities of the cities are getting more grow because the farmers were going to go into cities and cities had to keep away their nutrients . </s>
all the western empires are always the infrastructure , and they &apos;re <unk> . </s>
yeah ? </s>
china was different . </s>
you &apos;ve got <unk> civilization for perfect years because you &apos;ve always been able to put the nutrients . </s>
even today , if you &apos;re in china , you &apos;d expect to the food you expect to stay the toilet , until you &apos;re going to go out the toilet . </s>
because it &apos;s <unk> , and the nutrients is the same . </s>
you &apos;ve got them to lunch , not to <unk> . </s>
that means you can see the nutrients , how you can &apos;t get the nutrients . </s>
this is actually beautiful , if you do it , so agriculture , is , biogas , biogas , biogas , coupons , biogas , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and vegetables and vegetables . </s>
and the great thing is that the <unk> <unk> were in the favelas of the favelas around the favelas . </s>
so we don &apos;t have to be able to be bad at the time . </s>
we can support them , good . </s>
this is , of course , the <unk> is going to be . </s>
the byproduct is clean water . </s>
and they &apos;re so designed by the design that you could just unravel . </s>
that means that they go back to the <unk> . </s>
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over <unk> built over the last twenty years , none of these networks was ever <unk> . </s>
you could just be easily understood as easily as a liter of a liter , and then it would be a facility above . </s>
it &apos;s not happening . </s>
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people that are bad at all . </s>
we can support them , good . </s>
that means we need phosphorus . </s>
and by the way , if you want to do what they want to write on , in germany , the best line of all the <unk> is the ones that are in <unk> . </s>
unfortunately , they don &apos;t have to be in <unk> , but maybe you can carry the <unk> , let &apos;s get a little help . </s>
because the <unk> plant could be the phosphorus . </s>
and the need for . </s>
we see that phosphorus is really critical . </s>
and we see that it &apos;s going to be . </s>
we &apos;ve been focused on <unk> in holland now . </s>
the dutch government has explains the first country in the world , which phosphorus <unk> . </s>
but we need this . </s>
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s most violent world . </s>
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> . </s>
these are <unk> countries , the ocean rate of the <unk> control . </s>
and we can replace the oil we can replace in other places . </s>
but the phosphorus is not replacing . </s>
that &apos;s not about making a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about something right . </s>
and it &apos;s mostly questions about what &apos;s right on the right thing . </s>
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not to be efficiency . </s>
in holland , you understand because in holland , the country on flowers is built on flowers . </s>
yeah ? </s>
imagine if you &apos;re <unk> , if you have <unk> , and they come to fifty . </s>
completely inefficient . </s>
but all right , yeah ? </s>
or take a <unk> . </s>
a woman in germany , he had about six of your <unk> three times during your life . </s>
it &apos;s what we do . </s>
this is not exactly accurate , because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to be . </s>
but a <unk> , even in this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , right ? </s>
all of you , what &apos;s beautiful , is not efficient . </s>
that &apos;s not going to be <unk> , but we &apos;re not <unk> . </s>
what &apos;s the right thing ? </s>
not even more <unk> nor a little bit better , and it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> it and in the <unk> that entire materials to lose the materials of losing the materials that are going to lose ? </s>
imagine hitchcock <unk> . </s>
yeah ? </s>
if i <unk> them to the dinner party , and say , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water . </s>
wonderful , &quot; ? &quot; </s>
that &apos;s efficient . </s>
everything is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient . </s>
if you &apos;re going to get yourself in somebody ? </s>
yeah ? </s>
that means anything in life is not to be able to avoid . </s>
all the <unk> . </s>
we say the people , oh , you don &apos;t have a <unk> in the south . </s>
no , the doctor &apos;s right , yeah ? </s>
in every location , where you &apos;re <unk> , and you &apos;re going to sail again . </s>
but the wrong things . </s>
if you have the wrong things , you have a showman . </s>
we think of north , we think of north . </s>
there &apos;s a footprint . </s>
if you run , yeah , arthritis every footprint is to the ground . </s>
because the bottom is going to die off the wind , and the water is gone . </s>
if you &apos;re in italy , it means everybody knows that the water longer are longer . </s>
so , it &apos;s about making a big footprint that &apos;s a marsh . </s>
not <unk> . </s>
we say in germany . </s>
yeah ? </s>
but if i ask you , how do you have this with your wife ? </s>
what do you say ? </s>
sustainable . </s>
i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ? </s>
this is yes , the minimum . </s>
so saving , avoid , avoid . </s>
everybody &apos;s <unk> . </s>
and it &apos;s a bit like when you see in italy , as people are going to be the high bow of the car &apos; , it &apos;s called the car . </s>
because you know , this is a <unk> process . </s>
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , ya ? </s>
you can show that , i was there . </s>
but with the right design , please . </s>
we have a <unk> system that &apos;s actually at room &apos; worth of room &apos; liquid . </s>
they can go to where they go and stand . </s>
in two hours , they make it everywhere . </s>
and they &apos;re expecting a lot of rare plants , so they &apos;re going to be connected by the most expensive in biodiversity . </s>
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful . </s>
so it &apos;s two different ones . </s>
not all of course , it &apos;s supposed to be <unk> . </s>
a tv or a washing machine , they only use them , they &apos;re not going to use it . </s>
just the things that are <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who have to be so that they have to go into biological systems . </s>
the things that are used used , they go into technical systems . </s>
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems . </s>
yeah ? </s>
for example , the <unk> , yeah ? </s>
very direct advertising , not for the company , but for that they &apos;re helping now to make this business , these products are successful . </s>
because we don &apos;t do that things are more devoid of . </s>
yeah ? </s>
so if i take them to the food and say , this is free from <unk> , and then it helps you . </s>
no , we &apos;re hoping what &apos;s inside . </s>
positive . </s>
so not like <unk> . </s>
not even the way in the way . </s>
it &apos;s all , what &apos;s useful . </s>
these are the first ones where they can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and the rubber can go to the classroom , right ? </s>
all of it is <unk> . </s>
and if it &apos;s us , for nike , for nike , for nike , for nike and <unk> and all the textile . </s>
and this is half the most important points of all the most important points that causes them to be causes by the textile industry . </s>
so , about you ask , ask people to do with people . </s>
hey , <unk> , power is really serious ? </s>
because they &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> . </s>
and i &apos;m not sure whether they really <unk> . </s>
so , help me a little bit of it . </s>
but it &apos;s about . </s>
yeah . </s>
what &apos;s been happening right now is that . </s>
this is what we &apos;re going . </s>
we can do things that they &apos;re going to be when they nominate when they nominate , they can be in biological engineering . </s>
and there are the same thing . </s>
there &apos;s a direct <unk> . </s>
this is the first ecological species , actually , the thing is made , in circulation . </s>
so , again , so you can store the things that you can do . </s>
if you come to the bar , right ? </s>
remember the world &apos;s the list even ? </s>
if you &apos;re the trash . </s>
all these are all around , almost , almost . </s>
in the countries where people are going to come to their money . </s>
there &apos;s no way to the <unk> , but also , in the landscape , yes ? </s>
if we change the plastics , so that he can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , the <unk> , you can change the <unk> org , you can put it in israel or in the tunisia <unk> trees . </s>
yeah ? </s>
if you take these traffic , they <unk> , and the powder to plant trees . </s>
so this is the baby <unk> for the entire life , right now . </s>
so we need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
yeah , you know . </s>
yeah ? </s>
we can do that . </s>
we can all have to innovate all . </s>
i got a beer . </s>
meanwhile , there are lots of people and they can &apos;t get it . </s>
there &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , where everybody can contribute . </s>
so not saving more , they &apos;re not saving , it &apos;s not a <unk> , but more successful . </s>
do you make the curious ? </s>
thank you . </s>
the work of the sinaloa federation . </s>
music as a language . </s>
in the description of my talk , i was written as <unk> , so as a <unk> , so i &apos;m in the english <unk> . </s>
<unk> are recycled <unk> music , and they &apos;re recycled . </s>
that as a translator , you don &apos;t just vocabulary to say , but the deeper meaning of words and <unk> , it needs to understand a great translation , anyone knows that everybody who has to do with self-reflection . </s>
i can get from the germans to the english , you know , if you will , when it &apos;s about poetry or even if it &apos;s going to go . </s>
so , very alien , it &apos;s for <unk> , which we &apos;re doing , the musicians with our <unk> . </s>
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i just raised the mountain . </s>
you think that the composer has exactly everything that he &apos;s got to be here . </s>
in fact , the notes is very different and <unk> . </s>
these notes are about as just as just as a verbal verbal , albeit very , very seemingly <unk> , but a landscape . </s>
because in this <unk> , the smell of flowers , the <unk> is not too smell to smell the degree of the <unk> , not to feel the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
this is , the video has to investigate the <unk> of the <unk> in a different , which is , <unk> , concrete , <unk> <unk> . </s>
today i want to show you what i &apos;m going to do with this , so <unk> , even in a verbal language , opportunity . </s>
so basically , translation of translation . </s>
so i made it to do this whole thing about to be about to do , because if i was going to translate it , it would be used for me to translation of the translation of translation . </s>
so , the music is working for me as much as the spoken word language . </s>
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters a second . </s>
so it doesn &apos;t mean to read notes and the ones that it &apos;s going to be able to conceive of the piano or the right thing to hit the piano or the right thing to hit the piano . </s>
this would be the letters that you learned to paint . </s>
the point of the letters is , when you see the language . </s>
so , you need to be just as the following for the other person as the <unk> language . </s>
there &apos;s also <unk> whether you learn it for the <unk> , just can be passively understands , or you can talk to the musical capacity . </s>
the work of the <unk> is similar to the one of the <unk> . </s>
after all of you , after all , you have a piece of business , because you &apos;re excited about it , because you have to have to the last passenger <unk> of the creation of composition . </s>
and you &apos;re going to put information about the time in the <unk> . </s>
you read in the letters , <unk> , or <unk> , or if it &apos;s words , thoughts . </s>
you &apos;re like the work that he showed before and she &apos;s left . </s>
you compare nike . </s>
the <unk> , it &apos;s going to write . </s>
how do he affect it ? </s>
how were his <unk> , like the society and politics ? </s>
all of me . </s>
you think in these days , you think about the example of being able to look at the same images or literature . </s>
so , you know , you &apos;ve got to have a <unk> , you know , as a rich , to find the composers that you play , and it &apos;s always a bit easier to feel in him and feel . </s>
the composer is always going to be more to the friend that you &apos;re living together . </s>
and his concern is becoming more and more and more and more and more and more and more . </s>
since the notes everything else is a very detailed record of the composer , but just a scaffold , now i &apos;m starting to be able to make meaning with meaning and meaning . </s>
i &apos;m going to be written with my own words , what could be written between this debate . </s>
i &apos;m looking for what these sounds sound ? </s>
now for me and for the composers , and what they could mean for him today . </s>
everybody sound , every point gets to a sense , because i feel it because it &apos;s from my personal brain . </s>
it has to be in here and now be <unk> , i can &apos;t be my audience out that that &apos;s my cause . </s>
it &apos;s always the same time when i have the experience , the piece that i have to have as long as long as to experience how to experience . </s>
as you &apos;ve got a happy new day , although they &apos;re always going to be the same proportions of life , up , <unk> , <unk> , to work , so i &apos;m going to go back the same thing over and over again . </s>
i &apos;m a daily person that day change , my pulse goes down at night at night at night , and it takes a <unk> , it takes longer , that sound was coming back than to home . </s>
i suppose that &apos;s the end of the audience , consciously or no . </s>
all that influenced me and all that experience my experience with the composition . </s>
wonderful , even though i &apos;m talking to a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength . </s>
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> . </s>
you bring a new way of being a new way and it will be answered with a response . </s>
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have <unk> , and you can &apos;t be transformed . </s>
it makes great fun to make it music , and they have as the audience , as the music is alive . </s>
so every concert is a different concert . </s>
i &apos;m never going to play more like this , &quot; i &apos;m never going to play . </s>
i can &apos;t play that today like in the age of time . </s>
and i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more <unk> than today . </s>
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s some <unk> reflexes , but it &apos;s new <unk> . </s>
so nice example of it . </s>
it was on a <unk> for <unk> at my beloved old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> here . </s>
unfortunately , i was too much too young , so he was <unk> , so he started to study . </s>
but i had this great fortune , it was very early , with a long time , and so i was at his work at his work . </s>
i was 17 when i was going on a trip to a trip and played the last one of the four people talking about the four , a <unk> . </s>
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> for me . </s>
this is such a <unk> part . </s>
and in my <unk> , i said , <unk> . </s>
he <unk> and said , so , &quot; ? </s>
that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
because for me , they &apos;re memory . </s>
he was a big amount of time . </s>
well , with 17 , you &apos;re still , but no important memories . </s>
i play today all the time , and it &apos;s always helped me , although no one grade has changed . </s>
every time it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;ll read something new . </s>
an example of the other , actually , in fact , the <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , in <unk> light . </s>
he &apos;s got the <unk> <unk> of translated , as she saw it , like she &apos;s seen in this moment . </s>
his head of the <unk> . </s>
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable . </s>
meanwhile , i &apos;ve been eating older than <unk> years ago , when he wrote the piece . </s>
he &apos;s only lived years of living . </s>
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes , even if i can , you can find them . </s>
to keep <unk> , right with the composers . </s>
because the notes is the only connection directly to him . </s>
especially when he died . </s>
now , how do you talk to the language of music , and they &apos;re talking about the language of music ? </s>
i &apos;ve been doing for about equivalently to the <unk> language . </s>
often , the <unk> is so that you learn to read the notes . </s>
you learn to read the reading first , before you just ask a word . </s>
you learn to find the notes to the instrument . </s>
if you &apos;re all the time in time , and it &apos;s like this in your notes , then they come together , then sound sounds like music . </s>
if that &apos;s what happened , gets the students get the <unk> . </s>
on the interpretation of interpretation , it &apos;s spoken . </s>
well , there &apos;s a little bit of a second , that &apos;s a little bit of a piece . </s>
<unk> , slowly . </s>
and according to <unk> , f and b , etc . </s>
this is what most of you know . </s>
but even though you &apos;ve got this data , it &apos;s still just fleeting technical . </s>
and yet it &apos;s always interpretation . </s>
i wonder . </s>
i wonder that there &apos;s something quite a little bit of a <unk> . </s>
namely , that to make music on the instrument that creates music to make the musical musical , and feel like it before . </s>
that &apos;s what we sing . </s>
a child who taught the mistakes because it didn &apos;t have their parents , not going to do it . </s>
this is like the <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to have the other way to get it over a more opportunity to go to the sound . </s>
people who never mentioned , they &apos;ve never been talking directly to the body , like it &apos;s a tone . </s>
a <unk> with his own breath . </s>
the primary thing is to augment your body . </s>
our vocal chords to the <unk> , our hands and feet to dance . </s>
so the <unk> is the <unk> of my fingers . </s>
the tune from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance . </s>
the <unk> <unk> nowadays today is not <unk> . </s>
you don &apos;t need to make yourself music , when it &apos;s boring . </s>
no longer need to sing a <unk> or <unk> . </s>
each of your music is <unk> , if you &apos;re all going to be connected by the outside with music . </s>
sure there are some of you , say , yeah , but what do you do when i &apos;m not going to sing ? </s>
i ask you , you can &apos;t sing because they believe they can &apos;t sing ? </s>
or b , because they don &apos;t have learned ? </s>
so , in both of those two , it &apos;s not too late to start out whether they can &apos;t yet , or learning how to do this small muscles that are using <unk> . </s>
this can be train . </s>
or c because you &apos;ve got it <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> . </s>
and i ask , how did they work on this diagnosis ? </s>
you &apos;ve got a <unk> or a <unk> , like you &apos;re still saying it . </s>
or d , they don &apos;t like music and really want to do it to do it . </s>
what i &apos;ve been doing is , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing . </s>
but maybe you can also have a look at them . </s>
well , so you see , there &apos;s all a time a <unk> candidate . </s>
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music . </s>
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad . </s>
i was going to say , but certainly , you can tell if it doesn &apos;t like it or not . </s>
because i don &apos;t think it tells you , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m sorry , because i can &apos;t cook . </s>
so , they don &apos;t eat , not to be able to eat , just because they can &apos;t cook . </s>
so they don &apos;t have to be on classical music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument . </s>
listen to them , and say whether it &apos;s either or not . </s>
whether the music is to be <unk> or to sweet . </s>
say what they &apos;re doing . </s>
and then , with the time , they have a little bit more complicated , or even taste <unk> differences . </s>
why i &apos;m now about my audience , that it &apos;s also a very active thing ? </s>
because the music is a language , and a language is communicating there . </s>
a piece that you never did not look at it , has no force to work . </s>
the food that &apos;s been used by a fortune or a chef to eat , and not just <unk> for just a <unk> . </s>
so please listen to you if a music is playing . </s>
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> . </s>
if you &apos;re in a neighborhood where the adults are active than or at least rather , you hear a child , it &apos;s very easy to have a <unk> , asking , that color has been a flower ? </s>
can you play me in blue ? </s>
and the kid plays , after a <unk> , rather than a red flower now . </s>
and this is a very different than before . </s>
this was the beginning of a truly musical expression . </s>
so the first step is to a interpretation . </s>
and what happens if you &apos;re going to play a piece of today , the primal <unk> , or <unk> or <unk> , or even before the last 10 years ago ? </s>
meanwhile have the instruments . </s>
there was no more than an instrument , even more than an instrument . </s>
it wasn &apos;t yet been invented . </s>
i think the average was ignored , if he had the <unk> capacity of modern <unk> . </s>
i can &apos;t get the <unk> that bach stream , in the modern wing , to the occasion , what a <unk> <unk> can &apos;t . </s>
even though , you know , he was deaf when he was deaf . </s>
today is an modern orchestra in the position of what a orchestra has a orchestra from the time . </s>
so , the composers are the composers to <unk> the pieces that are called the <unk> . </s>
they become a bit of what they &apos;re doing in the mind . </s>
and also , what they think about today in the mind . </s>
or what i &apos;m doing today , because what they might have thought . </s>
thank you . </s>
you know what envy ? </s>
were they were supposed to be said ? </s>
and how did that ? </s>
well , in the way . </s>
i got a friend who drives a <unk> . </s>
if i come up with my little <unk> , and i was asking me to get this feeling . </s>
i &apos;m going through the head . </s>
i say , <unk> , what you need , &quot; you know , the n of the n is a big big car ? </s>
this is a bit of his value , which is the following half of his value . </s>
and even , you &apos;re much less than i do . </s>
why i have to afford to make an n of the car ? </s>
and then i got to one , that &apos;s more . </s>
it &apos;s against justice . </s>
and as i say the word justice , this is an awkward feeling . </s>
our organism has a great method to get to just like envy to disappear . </s>
you can try to try to talk about words like revenge or <unk> or <unk> . </s>
i want to share with this mechanism , or something that you might have is worth of what you might have is probably . </s>
the mechanism is from the lie . </s>
but think about the lie , as you heard you heard , as people say , no one has to be able to build a wall . </s>
and then he told them the point of view . </s>
and at such a way , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe that what he says . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> very easily easily , that it &apos;s definitely all different . </s>
he &apos;s not only they and not themselves . </s>
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about trying to do with it , they &apos;re going to deceive themselves . </s>
they need to be able to maintain a <unk> to maintain a global one . </s>
they can cheat less easily , yes , <unk> or for dinner . </s>
they need time . </s>
from this time , a anecdote , a anecdote that you may know . </s>
spanish <unk> picasso has a woman &apos;s wife . </s>
this woman has complained , the portrait would not see it . </s>
picasso &apos;s picasso , wait . </s>
it &apos;s always being done . </s>
and at this point , when you smile , you see how important that lie is and how much time they need to experience something , which artists really is very good at us . </s>
because artist have a <unk> ratio to lie . </s>
the artist &apos;s going to talk to you , and just about this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if you just look at the mirror . </s>
the artist shares you have a portrait of a portrait of what they just will be familiar with , if you look at this work every time . </s>
then the only form this particular one , it couldn &apos;t look alike , and it &apos;s always being able to always be always . </s>
so here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great tool to improve our <unk> . </s>
and not just in art , in the middle of the time , in the mythology , it &apos;s going to be back on . </s>
you may know this idea of the lady that every morning , and asked him , who &apos;s the most beautiful , who &apos;s the most beautiful place in the country ? </s>
one day , this mirrors , yeah , there &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
and so on the seven mountains , and so on . </s>
and you also know how much hostility from this true , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true <unk> . </s>
but we should just do it to you that you can &apos;t say , a woman can &apos;t say there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere in another way . </s>
here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in <unk> <unk> , all over again . </s>
we need to be these lie that the deception of the deception , without losing the ones we can &apos;t . </s>
we don &apos;t just have the art in art , but also in science that &apos;s how science is happening . </s>
and there &apos;s this story of the women &apos;s history of <unk> . </s>
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of man . </s>
that person &apos;s been from apes to do , yes , there &apos;s a shared civilization between humans and apes . </s>
and then she ran her to her husband and said , that &apos;s not what charles there was writing . </s>
the human being is to have one of the apes of the apes , or a common ancestor . </s>
no , no , that &apos;s not . </s>
and when it &apos;s true , we have to stop that people have to do this . </s>
why is that people have probably been a little bit of difference when it &apos;s true ? </s>
because we can &apos;t live with this life we can &apos;t live . </s>
because we surveyed these questions , this sense , great , great , great , <unk> from the highest creatures , not by a organism , from such a organism , like a organism , and otherwise things like a organism , that &apos;s for us . </s>
so we can &apos;t imitate those things . </s>
we need to stop that people are doing this as long ago , especially if they &apos;re true . </s>
so you see how slowly this mechanism is going to arise and like the traces that he &apos;s going to look like the trace , that he &apos;s going to have to be able to do something different from ourselves , i want to give you another story . </s>
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean . </s>
my wife has told me . </s>
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she said she was talking about one student . </s>
an <unk> student . </s>
they like special , because he has to have a pitch to have a pitch unto . </s>
and they asked him what are your hobbies ? </s>
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the firemen . </s>
and because i &apos;m at the fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things . </s>
yeah , you feel it when they &apos;re <unk> , there &apos;s something wrong with this . </s>
i said my wife , always said , if a human being in a moral attempt to do it because we &apos;re trying to replace it through the <unk> model . </s>
do that , and then they experience the sentence . </s>
although i &apos;m at the fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things . </s>
you feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the same . </s>
so a little <unk> , who cares about <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m interested in <unk> . </s>
but there &apos;s no way to look at some of the things , where you learn how to fire fire . </s>
there &apos;s only the only thing you see . </s>
he was looking at . </s>
and <unk> , you also say that you &apos;d like to go out and then they &apos;re willing to tell you when the fire is burning . </s>
no , it &apos;s just better than we show that we are <unk> to the dangers that others only do when they lay fire . </s>
here you have this little mechanism . </s>
this <unk> that it &apos;s actually turned out to the <unk> , that it &apos;s actually a little related to the fire , but that it &apos;s not true . </s>
here they have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious , the immediately , the immediately , the immediately , the immediately , the immediately , the immediately , the immediately , the immediately , the <unk> , you know , they can also do something else , so that they &apos;re going to be much better for them and others can sound . </s>
so just that way , just like this , we &apos;re going to use the language of the political times over the language of the political times . </s>
well , we know that something else is . </s>
but we know if we are the <unk> , are social <unk> to be very sensitive . </s>
we can &apos;t just do that . </s>
it &apos;s impossible to work like this , to present to present . </s>
so i want to tell you about what we found in my institute . </s>
after what these are deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality , which we actually already know that they &apos;re bouncing to spread out of it . </s>
so , i want to leave you two , maybe three of them . </s>
the first example of a drill from you know , and some of you appreciate , not only need to use . </s>
i mean the soul . </s>
what &apos;s the soul ? </s>
the soul is something like this , is about a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not from <unk> , <unk> nature . </s>
and if you have a person who &apos;s the kind of thing that you have a soul , you own a soul , or you can also say that the soul were <unk> , and blood , something delightful , something to be , sort of <unk> , something delightful , something to be in the soul and blood , something poetic , something poetic , and you know ,
and by this soul , you think that you &apos;re sort of <unk> in this elliptical , in this <unk> nature , <unk> is in the <unk> , <unk> is in the latin , the <unk> , present . </s>
and when this <unk> is then over the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature , with nature , with nature . </s>
and then he can go . </s>
this is the idea of how the soul are going to be . </s>
so they would be able to be sure . </s>
so we &apos;re going to do it as a bit of what was going to be present for our lives . </s>
and if you have this mortar , then you understand the logic that we experience this happiness by a lie to enhance a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make a lie to make
because now they can apply a <unk> . </s>
<unk> you know , you know , from school . </s>
this is now a <unk> that describes us a logic . </s>
and this is the way , that &apos;s the most difficult part in my talk . </s>
here &apos;s some logic , but also the willingness to lie . </s>
namely , that they can use these logic wrong . </s>
in this <unk> , three sentences . </s>
the first sentence , <unk> claimed , there &apos;s no soul . </s>
so the second sentence is , so if you look right , he &apos;s not <unk> . </s>
now , there &apos;s a third set . </s>
i sat there , i &apos;ve got this shot . </s>
a third set of life that immediately immediately is to people who have a strong sense for a soul . </s>
the people who has no soul that is dead and can &apos;t say anything . </s>
and here &apos;s what they &apos;re doing . </s>
this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk to expression . </s>
you see it immediately . </s>
the first two sentences that are logical correct . </s>
i can say anything . </s>
the logic doesn &apos;t exist about reality . </s>
i can say , the <unk> is a man . </s>
and when i got right , it &apos;s the most primitive one . </s>
if i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not a man &apos;s dilemma . </s>
the logic doesn &apos;t mean . </s>
i can argue . </s>
but the key thing is , if i was right , it &apos;s going to be . </s>
so when the <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul . </s>
secondly , when he &apos;s got to have the soul , he &apos;s not <unk> . </s>
these things are logical correct . </s>
and now , what our most sacred consciousness is immediately , can you do something . </s>
it depends on a third of a third that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how it &apos;s been proven to be proven and innovate . </s>
because actually , we don &apos;t think that the soul are not the soul or not . </s>
but with this logic that just make it simple , that two sentences are correct , and a third <unk> , that looks like , as he would have anything to do with this , so we can save our <unk> . </s>
so we pretend to be impossible without any soul . </s>
and we &apos;re very happy about this . </s>
we can continue to different things about different examples . </s>
in the present tense , we have a very modern example , that &apos;s dipping the <unk> <unk> . </s>
and so , look at another <unk> , a <unk> of philosophy , present . </s>
so that &apos;s what it has to do with this , that we go back into the <unk> century . </s>
there was a scholars that was named <unk> , and after the <unk> is named <unk> . </s>
the <unk> is an area that &apos;s made of nature . </s>
the wing isn &apos;t that soul . </s>
this is a <unk> . </s>
and if you put the right in the middle of two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> . </s>
because he doesn &apos;t know what he was going to go first . </s>
so he &apos;s right in the middle . </s>
so the <unk> are being introduced . </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> each other . </s>
there &apos;s nothing at all . </s>
just one example , if you get another example , so if you get a greater water , he doesn &apos;t need a reason for you . </s>
automatically on the right thought . </s>
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re going to be used in nature in nature , <unk> , you know , <unk> , by the larger <unk> , which they have to feel like a free will . </s>
and if we &apos;re also at <unk> , the <unk> , i remember the <unk> for the <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s a scholars that &apos;s called a scholars called a scholars called a <unk> , and you say , <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> . </s>
now we can make the second set of <unk> and say , if the wolf <unk> has come to , then he has no <unk> . </s>
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct . </s>
and what we can read almost daily to read that they find in this third set up . </s>
so the looks like this , who has not <unk> , not for its actions and claims , and they &apos;re going to be pulled by the responsibility and that &apos;s been <unk> . </s>
again , they &apos;ve got it back . </s>
actually , you really have to prove whether it &apos;s like <unk> . </s>
but the analytics of deception allows us to do that , as the first set of <unk> depended on the opposite without any evidence . </s>
and now they can just do anything if you want to do anything about anything and especially if they want to make people happy to the art . </s>
practice , for example , if you encounter a person you can &apos;t say , there &apos;s no <unk> . </s>
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , that means that . </s>
they don &apos;t call that , that would be a little political <unk> . </s>
say there &apos;s no <unk> . </s>
immediately , you &apos;ll have a way to use this for granted that they can &apos;t prove to . </s>
and you &apos;ve got a problem . </s>
because whilst they &apos;re busy torturing that they can &apos;t prove that they can &apos;t prove that there is no encryption , is the guy is happy . </s>
it &apos;s quite happy because he &apos;s fooled . </s>
because he was looking at a <unk> , he doesn &apos;t get himself . </s>
because actually , this person is not interested in action . </s>
he &apos;s just interested in itself , to prove to the need to prove to see that there are . </s>
so , in the way the <unk> experience of the <unk> , they &apos;re the most mysterious of the lie . </s>
and once you have a way to feel this <unk> to feel this <unk> to people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make them in those ways . </s>
thank you for your attention . </s>
yeah , good afternoon . </s>
i &apos;ve asked me whether i &apos;m going to mention it . </s>
it &apos;s one of the most profound here from this great <unk> and asked me to see if i &apos;m talking about a talk , and my idea to bring my idea . </s>
i have to say , you &apos;ve got to talk about it , it really taught me to talk to my idea . </s>
and i may have been probably about my <unk> , i &apos;m going to go to you . </s>
but it &apos;s of course , the sum of course , is very many ideas . </s>
i think i probably have a lot of the two reasons that i &apos;ve been really <unk> to the generation that had been achieved for this awful <unk> , because i &apos;ve been studying the generation that had been really <unk> , and now , i was going to say , today , i think , &quot; i think . </s>
and i got it in the middle of the <unk> for a <unk> , because i didn &apos;t want to make that , and they had it not . </s>
there were the <unk> <unk> . </s>
the <unk> was all the <unk> , including the <unk> <unk> . </s>
the hot water today . </s>
because a good engineer , has either been built cars , or <unk> . </s>
but the ones like the n <unk> , which was from a kind of <unk> watts of the day , that was a toy . </s>
and in berlin , there was a crazy thing . </s>
i &apos;m the <unk> grateful that he was the word again , because after the <unk> , you didn &apos;t use the word , because all the left was . </s>
but it was not like this , this was not like this . </s>
there was so that there was 140,000 <unk> and a half of them sitting in <unk> , where you were sitting in <unk> , where you &apos;d have the evil . </s>
the place of the <unk> , but that was a <unk> and <unk> and wind and made wind and made me the middle of the mid university . </s>
and , in fact , many of what was told me , touches me , because many , many beautiful , the most exciting of the world that i also have to do . </s>
i worked in the middle of the exact same , that was <unk> . </s>
we were in a <unk> . </s>
if one said was the <unk> that has a totally <unk> , and i &apos;ve been really hard to see if i had a totally <unk> , and i &apos;ve always been hard to see if i had always a <unk> , and i &apos;ve always been hard to have a <unk> of money at your child , you have the money for your child . </s>
it &apos;s busy with the <unk> . </s>
and that was really , very <unk> , and you get it into this country , where i asked me , &quot; there &apos;s a thousand <unk> , and then , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the collective , if that really ought to be the neat thing . </s>
and i got this up to <unk> <unk> , and then we have some friends , i &apos;ve been able to have been able to have been able to be able to have been fully <unk> , who then put the <unk> <unk> one of the world &apos;s largest <unk> in the world . </s>
but also , we have a <unk> , but also there , we have a problem of course , and it &apos;s just crazy , it &apos;s just crazy , that starts to say small and go to the next topic , we have a little group , which is not to start what &apos;s going to be doing , that &apos;s not going to be all the way we
and i &apos;ve got you a project i want to do you now , right now . </s>
and the title of the act was , yes , like , how to drop down to a hundred percent . </s>
and we just have a relatively <unk> story , where could you have a very clever thing to be able to do because you know , you know , you know , a memory of sense today . </s>
on this island , this is the island <unk> on the <unk> . </s>
yeah , these are the data . </s>
there &apos;s been thousands of people . </s>
now , they have a long rate of deaths . </s>
and the question is , why haven &apos;t they ? </s>
that &apos;s just irrelevant . </s>
if you <unk> each other , it starts to fail , but the system is failing . </s>
i &apos;m going to tell the politicians that they &apos;re in <unk> our facility . </s>
and why ? &quot; and why ? </s>
we &apos;ve been in the middle of the population . </s>
but i can &apos;t be a problem . </s>
right , we have seven percent and our network in europe , the european web is seen . </s>
if we had 20 percent of the same problems that people have on this island . </s>
the question was just , was actually the first one with the first one with the island , just had just the time . </s>
how big would be because it &apos;s actually a battery so that you &apos;re so like an island of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , maybe even 70 percent renewable . </s>
and yeah , i &apos;ll go again . </s>
the conventional system around the world . </s>
by the way , a hundred <unk> performance on the world , <unk> in the world . </s>
this is the equivalent of 100 times because it &apos;s particularly very quickly . </s>
the <unk> world , the present , is to add , because you don &apos;t need any of it . </s>
it &apos;s fast . </s>
you take this box . </s>
and then it &apos;s like this . </s>
in fact , the <unk> , two , and waited for a second . </s>
yeah , this is the load of the load . </s>
we also have very detailed data . </s>
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule of the rule of the rule of the rule , is a system that &apos;s a system that &apos;s just going to be here in small quantities . </s>
our goal was to say , okay , and our goal was to say , okay , okay , okay . </s>
and the wind becomes <unk> and the wind , the sun makes the load of the greater energy savings . </s>
and if you &apos;re thinking about 20 , 30 percent renewables are going to be , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , they have to hook out the front door . </s>
that means that you have to care about the renewables of making the renewables of taking the entire grid . </s>
and that &apos;s only if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in some way . </s>
this has no one in the world . </s>
so this is a little bit of the little style , so you can also see a little <unk> of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
people ask me what was her because actually , in <unk> , in <unk> ? </s>
that &apos;s what happened . </s>
if you want to take several of these <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re supposed to build a network , it becomes extremely complicated . </s>
and our goal was to be able to get on 70 to the 2008 , and then there &apos;s this kind of thing here , the last 10 , twenty percent of the 10 , twenty percent of the 10 , twenty percent , it &apos;s not going to work , and also not work that you do that . </s>
this is going to be a more obvious case , who then hydrogen , methane , methane , power of your gas , you know , or a <unk> , that will be . </s>
you have to go into a <unk> and not just <unk> balance . </s>
we just wanted to know what is about a regular , <unk> battery battery battery . </s>
how far do you get there ? </s>
and then a whole bunch of simulation is going on . </s>
and the sun and sun and the load cell and the load cell phones and came to the outcome , a whole thing that you need to see the <unk> , a whole thing that you needed to <unk> , is about <unk> cents . </s>
this was the first two six years ago . </s>
and then we said , okay , okay , okay . </s>
and then , then we have a business model . </s>
we &apos;re cheap like <unk> , if the average five percent a year is going to increase in three percent . </s>
and then we started to <unk> the <unk> . </s>
what would have done anything ? </s>
have investors to investors , i have new <unk> . </s>
we were only five people to build a society back to society . </s>
and here again , the plot . </s>
the brown is sort of the most common system , the green is our system . </s>
that our system has a <unk> , because we &apos;ve got to have divergent percent with diesel , and also a <unk> on the other things that don &apos;t work on . </s>
and the <unk> that the <unk> was the island of the island , has meant that we find it . </s>
but we also don &apos;t want to support you that you can solve the problem . </s>
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can build the electrical one in the scale of the island of the island of the <unk> . </s>
that means we have to redesign the largest economy of the world . </s>
here it &apos;s . </s>
the world is naturally from japan in the trap . </s>
and <unk> is a <unk> in the world , today , developed developed , and then <unk> <unk> to the japanese . </s>
it &apos;s one , it &apos;s a very , very big battery . </s>
it has a megawatt up and you can make six hours of long long , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re doing <unk> . </s>
and then they did . </s>
we also have a <unk> in the same size , as he was there , where hall would be in the hall , in the hall that &apos;s been the complete dynamic of this web , here &apos;s the full of the <unk> that we simulate the web , which we simulate the net . </s>
over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable to <unk> the <unk> in the net . </s>
and here you can see this stuff . </s>
we can also put <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
here we see this again here again , here again , here again , here again , the whole <unk> . </s>
and what we did was since then , the year was then done , until today , everything that &apos;s been doing now , everything that &apos;s going to be <unk> , what &apos;s going on between the individual system , to develop in software , we &apos;ve done it . </s>
so we don &apos;t have a <unk> , we define the <unk> that &apos;s just between the subject and the subject of the web and the subject and all of them . </s>
you have to communicate to battery , you have to communicate , you have to communicate to the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated . </s>
the beauty is to the issue that you &apos;re going on in this island of all today today , this is basically the <unk> of the <unk> that we can get , if we want to extend our percentage of devices . </s>
so this is what we &apos;ve done in the moment , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , like this , for instance , for example , we have the wind to 70 percent , so we wind the wind and the sun . </s>
<unk> offers <unk> . </s>
so <unk> , a <unk> . </s>
we can start to integrate a <unk> , <unk> , can you have the load of load . </s>
that means if you &apos;re renewable , you won &apos;t do it without any of you . </s>
you can never walk through n n , you can do that , you should do whatever you do in any case , but you never get to buy any storage completely . </s>
and this is the message of the message . </s>
so many people , and look at this , because you can see what you get to . </s>
if we brought down the car , then you don &apos;t have this spinning mass that has a certain inertia in the grid . </s>
and our <unk> are basically <unk> in the way , just from a very large <unk> , where it &apos;s always going to be in europe everywhere . </s>
we look at this network , see the fly , and if it melts <unk> &apos;s infrared , and if it melts <unk> &apos;s nest , then we &apos;ll just grow up a little <unk> , then we &apos;ll go back to the end , then we &apos;ll go back up . </s>
that &apos;s the system . </s>
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly . </s>
if you <unk> the somewhere , then it takes a little bit of time . </s>
the <unk> is at least 10 seconds to keep the net , and keep the net net . </s>
and in time , they can respond to another . </s>
if you don &apos;t have any more , this spinning , you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and we can tackle this big battery two milliseconds . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of things that are there on there . </s>
and the message is , we need to be based on this future , if we were able to do our goals , 20 percent , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s like , if we want to reach the damn , we want to reach the damn , we want to reach the damn
then we have to put our <unk> capacity in the grid . </s>
<unk> is just trying to hold the power to hold the frequency . </s>
yeah , this is a <unk> at the moment , <unk> of the <unk> , because we don &apos;t know , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not going to go . </s>
and we &apos;re trying to just find out that you can provide the capacity to break the capacity to break down by giving rise to the grid . </s>
there &apos;s been now studies a lot of studies . </s>
and to this purpose , people would always look at this point and see our <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> of our <unk> . </s>
and indeed , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you put a piece of a very far future . </s>
and many discussions that i had in the last six years , was similar to the debate that i had been in the last 30 years to <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s not like , <unk> , we have all of it , we &apos;ve never got to do it . </s>
we &apos;ve got extensive <unk> <unk> in germany . </s>
this is <unk> . </s>
and i just go from that we &apos;re going to be the same capacity for the same capacity for the same world , and i just become the same capacity for the world . </s>
just very simple , it &apos;s going to come . </s>
there &apos;s such a whole bunch of <unk> and <unk> . </s>
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve experienced now in the last two years that scientists are asking on my site . </s>
we &apos;ve got now over tens of millions of <unk> , including <unk> , to <unk> the net net . </s>
next april , in the next april . </s>
so , from so , there &apos;s a way of all of you , there &apos;s a change in there , and just from this <unk> , to the idea , the definition , 100 percent renewable is true . </s>
and if you &apos;re renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system . </s>
so far , in discussions , these <unk> , who are doing <unk> , who are doing a complete little tool that has done with our ignorance . </s>
the question is , just simply when you &apos;re making a totally independent , or <unk> <unk> , who will be <unk> in the world , the somewhere in the world will become more <unk> in the world , they &apos;re a island . </s>
then they consume what &apos;s going on sun and wind there , where they live . </s>
and this is so a bit of a bit of a <unk> and i &apos;m also <unk> , and they said they &apos;re told , solar power . </s>
and that &apos;s what we do , and so , as well as the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can be an collective , and you use a little plug , here &apos;s a little bit together . </s>
and i just want to encourage you to just encourage you , in the sense that you assign a little bit of a little bit of a little crazy , and also a vision . </s>
and you really have to stay quite a <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to go . </s>
thank you . </s>
as steve , the los angeles times , one day , the streets of the streets of los angeles , he stopped a wonderful music . </s>
it came from a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , the <unk> , who had two strings . </s>
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles later a book , which was purchased <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and he was an <unk> of the <unk> of his
nathaniel left back , <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived in the streets of <unk> bin laden . </s>
i recommend you all follow to read and read the movie book , or looking at the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful idea that between these two men , so that &apos;s not just the wonderful idea that between these two men , so that &apos;s the <unk> , nathaniel journey from the street . </s>
i met for a long time in 2008 , two years ago , in the eastern <unk> hall . </s>
he had a bunch of beethoven and fourth level and fourth thing behind the stage to imagine me . </s>
he was talking about the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and hillary clinton and i think the dodgers world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world forum <unk> <unk> , and all of the first <unk> of the first <unk> in the last few of the world &apos;s population . </s>
we came to the subject of music , and a few days later , i got a email , which was that nathaniel was interested in my <unk> surgery . </s>
i have to mention that there was a medical treatment because it was already with dense and <unk> , a trauma that has been treated with his whole life . </s>
as a result , it &apos;s especially vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , which are sometimes that awful , and he &apos;s going to be <unk> , in the streets of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> of his own mind . </s>
and in just as a <unk> , nathaniel was nathaniel , when we were working with our first time in the walt disney hall , he had this insane <unk> in his eyes and lost totally lost . </s>
he was talking about the unseen bc and smoke and over the way that somebody was in the future . </s>
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that i could lose him to be able to destroy the violin , if i started , and <unk> and other kinds of metals <unk> to the <unk> . </s>
so i just started playing on . </s>
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven . </s>
and as i played my mind , i realized that in <unk> eyes too , a <unk> shift . </s>
it was like it was a invisible of a invisible school , a chemical reaction to the size of my game . </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
and as a miracle he took his violin and started to play some clips from <unk> and asked me to end them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
we started talking about music , starting from the stream , and i started talking about beethoven , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> . </s>
and i realized that he wasn &apos;t just a <unk> knowledge about music , but it &apos;s also connecting him to her , but it &apos;s also a close personal relationship with her . </s>
he was talking about her with a passion and a understanding , i just understanding my colleagues in the township los angeles . </s>
by talking about music was from this <unk> , <unk> man who was laid by los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , fine , <unk> , fine , fine , fine . </s>
music is medicine . music is changing . </s>
for the other means music , health . </s>
because the music allowed it to him about his thoughts and creativity to his imagination and creativity in a little bit . </s>
and so he <unk> his <unk> . </s>
i understood that this is the nature of art . </s>
so , this is why we &apos;re going to make music , so we &apos;re doing something that belongs to us all , in all of us , deep inside us , deeply <unk> , our artistic lens , through our creativity . </s>
and the reality that we all have to reach all of us , and moves , inspired and <unk> . </s>
what nathaniel &apos;s going to do is to get him back into a community of friends . </s>
the <unk> force of the music took him back into a family of musicians that his talent was recognized , and it <unk> him . </s>
and i &apos;m going to be again with nathaniel hall , whether in the walt disney hall , or in <unk> , in <unk> , because he remembered me why i was a musician . </s>
thank you . </s>
bruno : thank you very much . </s>
robert gupta . </s>
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the <unk> . </s>
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me . </s>
so i &apos;ve been a lot of fishes in my life . </s>
i just loved two . </s>
this first is more like a very passionate time . </s>
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good , <unk> , a <unk> on the <unk> . </s>
what a fish . </s>
even better , he was convicted of the supposedly <unk> of the world &apos;s standards . </s>
so you could feel about it , you &apos;ll sell it . </s>
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months . </s>
one day , the head of the day , and asked me whether i could be a <unk> of a <unk> of a event , and i could be concerned about sustainability of the farm . </s>
&quot; i said . </s>
here was a company that was tried to solve the basis of our chefs , how are we going to have fish in our <unk> ? </s>
in the last 50 years we have the oceans as we &apos;ve gotten forests on the ocean . </s>
it &apos;s hard to copulate the destruction . </s>
90 percent of the big fish that we love to do , the tuna , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed . </s>
it &apos;s almost nothing more . </s>
so , it &apos;s probably or <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future . </s>
many arguments about it , <unk> <unk> , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . </s>

let &apos;s call it . </s>
&quot; &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to have the facts , so far outside the ocean , that they don &apos;t seem to be authorized . &quot; </s>
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far out that the waste of our fish will not be concentrated . &quot; </s>
and then he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world . </s>
this <unk> <unk> to one &quot; a &quot; war said . </s>
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot; </s>

&quot; <unk> , what ? &quot; </s>
&quot; sustainable proteins said . </s>
&quot; great . &quot; </s>
and at that night , i was in bed thinking , &quot; what &apos;s going to be a sustainable protein ? </s>
so i just called the next day , just before the event , it &apos;s going to be on . </s>
i said , &quot; no , what &apos;s going to be sustainable proteins ? &quot; </s>
he said he didn &apos;t even know . he &apos;s going to be afraid . </s>
well , i &apos;m going to upgrade with a few people in the company , no one could finally give me a very simple answer . i finally had finally <unk> . </s>
let &apos;s call it out . </s>
&quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; what are the sustainable protein ? &quot; </s>
now , he &apos;s got some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> . </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; yeah , feathers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; how much percent of the <unk> is chicken ? &quot; </s>
and maybe two percent . </s>
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , he said . </s>
i said , &quot; no , what &apos;s sustainable , to feed , in the middle of the fish ? &quot; </s>
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there are just too much chicken in the world . &quot; </s>
i &apos;m not interested in this fish . </s>
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m a game . </s>
no , i &apos;ve actually got <unk> from this fish , because i swear , the fish after this conversation after this entertainment has been chicken . </s>

astonishingly , he was still delicious . </s>
who can make a fish that well after he was <unk> ? </s>
i can &apos;t , but this guy can be done . </s>
let &apos;s call him <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> . </s>
and no , he &apos;s not going to be the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least on the way that they and i was going to understand . </s>
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> la <unk> . </s>
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner . </s>
it &apos;s close to the stream . </s>
and to point to the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> . </s>
they were terrified of <unk> <unk> on what was essentially true . </s>
they made this , by the land that they &apos;re doing . </s>
they built these complicated , and they were <unk> water from the country and beyond water . </s>
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , not economically . </s>
and more carefully , it was a catastrophe . </s>
it &apos;s got about 90 percent of the birds around , which is a lot of birds . </s>
and so , the spanish that was bought the country on land . </s>
what did they do ? </s>
they have the flow of water . </s>
they literally <unk> the lever . </s>
instead of <unk> them , they used the channels to get the water back . </s>
they &apos;re <unk> the canals . </s>
they created a <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and <unk> and his company that we have found completely <unk> . </s>
the farm is incredible . </s>
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this . </s>
you &apos;re looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are <unk> channels and these density , are <unk> . </s>
i was not a long time ago . </s>
he &apos;s a incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of the kiss in the kissing . &quot; </s>
okay ? so we were and we were fighting by the wetlands and i was <unk> and <unk> , and i was <unk> to my knees and <unk> spraying a <unk> . </s>
here he lifts a rare <unk> . </s>
now , he &apos;s the <unk> of phytoplankton . </s>
and here , he sees a pattern of footage that &apos;s called the <unk> . </s>
it turns out that <unk> has been the biggest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa . </s>
i asked him how to have become a <unk> system . </s>
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish . </s>
i am an expert for relationships . &quot; </s>
and then he goes and rotate in more central and algae and curious <unk> . </s>
and don &apos;t understand me , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , so in the way that kind of like that , that &apos;s in the way that kind of like this . </s>
it &apos;s great , but i was love . </s>
and my head was weak , was weak , <unk> , which i had on the <unk> . </s>
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it matter that your fish are so good ? &quot; </s>
he pointed to the algae . </s>
&quot; i know , boy , the phytoplankton , the relationships , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible . </s>
but what &apos;s eating your fishes ? </s>
how is the <unk> ? &quot; </s>
well , he &apos;s begun to tell me that it &apos;s so much that &apos;s so much that the fish were eating , which they would eat in the wild . </s>
the <unk> biomass , the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish is . </s>
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s no food . </s>
the one of a farm that you hear your animals don &apos;t run out ? </s>
i was on the day i was walking on this site with <unk> , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for one place , that of course , &quot; for a place that would be so naturally , so naturally , i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot; </s>
the moment was it as if a director director would have saved an <unk> . </s>
and we pick up the corner and we &apos;re offered to the most incredible of the most incredible , thousands and thousands of acres of <unk> , a literally carpet carpet carpet carpet , literally the eye carpet . </s>
&quot; it said , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink . </s>
she <unk> . &quot; </s>
<unk> ? i was totally confused . </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> they don &apos;t follow your fish ? &quot; </s>
&quot; yeah , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds . </s>
now last year , on this site , more than 250 species species have been a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s now today , and one of the most important liberal <unk> in europe has become a very degraded in europe . </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> , isn &apos;t the last thing that you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot; </s>
he &apos;s going to his head , no . </s>
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to be <unk> on , not . </s>
this is a <unk> network . </s>
the <unk> eat the shrimp . </s>
shrimp eat the <unk> . </s>
so the kids ever system , the better so the system . &quot; </s>
okay , let &apos;s give us the parachute . a farm that &apos;s aligning their animals and a farm that &apos;s their own success to their own . </s>
but also a <unk> . </s>
oh , and by the way , this <unk> is not even more about this . </s>
they went into a city hall , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> . </s>
every morning , they fly in the farm . </s>
and then they fly back to miles back miles . </s>
they do that , because they can follow the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . </s>
seriously . </s>
i had a kind of <unk> journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> . </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> , flies , flying them up north miles , and then they came back miles at night ? </s>
do that for the kids ? &quot; </s>
he looked at me , as i was a song from the whitney of the whitney . </s>
he said , &quot; no . they do it , because the food is better . &quot; </s>
i haven &apos;t mentioned the skin of my beloved , the delicious was , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . </s>
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste . </s>
i never really almost never . </s>
and yet , when i tried to test them , they &apos;re not going to go into <unk> , they &apos;re not going to go into <unk> . </s>
she &apos;s going to be able to look like , as if you take a bite from the ocean . </s>
i mentioned this towards <unk> and he <unk> . </s>
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a sponge . </s>
it &apos;s the last word of the world , before the body . </s>
it has developed in the course of evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
and then he said , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot; </s>
okay . a farm that &apos;s going to be a fish , a farm that &apos;s their success to their own <unk> . </s>
and then i realized when he says , a farm that has no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because the water that is connecting by this farm , and it comes from this farm , they come from the river . </s>
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s all the things that are happening to be about trying to lead to be able to lead chemical . </s>
and when it &apos;s been expanding by the system , and this is the water clean as it &apos;s <unk> . </s>
the system is so healthy , it cleans water . </s>
so not just a farm that &apos;s not just to be familiar with their animals , not just a farm that literally their own success in the health , but a farm that literally has a <unk> , and not just for those fishes , but it &apos;s also for you and me . </s>
because if the water hits the water , it &apos;s in the atlantic ocean . </s>
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that should be doing that , and that should be doing it because that , as romantic , it &apos;s been wrong . </s>
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> . </s>
what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one of one , in the food actually , in foods . </s>
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit to radical . </s>
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re painful . </s>
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re eating food . we eat . </s>
and when you say that the things are the things that the future good is someone &apos;s reassuring pointing anywhere and says , &quot; hey , hey , hey , people , i love <unk> , but how are they feed the world ? </s>
how do they feed the world ? &quot; </s>
is i going to be honest ? </s>
i don &apos;t like this question . </s>
no , not because we &apos;ve got enough calories to feed the world over just . </s>
a billion people are going to starve . </s>
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> , in the distribution of distribution , not the <unk> . </s>
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;ve been the logic of the <unk> that we &apos;ve been going to have over the last 50 years . </s>
now , the <unk> of the herbivores , <unk> chemicals , chemicals in the earth , chemicals , chemicals , chemicals , and the whole time they &apos;ve just asked the agribusiness , and the whole time they have the agribusiness , how awful can it be ? &quot; </s>
this was the reason . it was the police . it was the director of american agriculture . </s>
we should call them what she &apos;s like , a virtual <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , the quickly <unk> capital , that &apos;s exactly what a <unk> <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s not a meter , and it &apos;s not agriculture . </s>
our <unk> is not threatened by <unk> , but because of <unk> resources , because of <unk> resources , but because of <unk> resources , we have to do it now , because of <unk> resources , but because of <unk> resources , we have to do it now , because of <unk> resources , but because of <unk> resources , we have to do it now , because of
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> , not by <unk> , not by conserving , not by <unk> , not by <unk> and nets , but in the ocean . </s>
they want the world ? </s>
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ? </s>
or better , how can we create conditions that will enable to feed itself ? </s>
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future . </s>
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s been done . </s>
and the world &apos;s , chemistry and machines and never have really good for lunch . </s>
let &apos;s look at the way that we see this . </s>
this is the one that &apos;s been on two billion years . </s>
look like <unk> , farmers , like <unk> , and look like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
they &apos;re not going to be <unk> , you know , the <unk> of <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re not only a very , farmers that are not only , but experts for relationships . </s>
because they are the ones that are also experts in flavor . </s>
and when i really honestly , you &apos;re better than i &apos;m going to be the one . </s>
you know , this is me right , because if that &apos;s the future &apos;s most dominant foods , they will be delicious . </s>
thank you . </s>
if i want to show you today , it &apos;s the one thing the data that we consume , bigger is more than the sum of your parts , and instead of information thinking about <unk> , i want to make patterns that you &apos;re going to use to think about how we can use trends that otherwise wouldn &apos;t be visible . </s>
so , what we see is a typical reef of age . </s>
the program that i &apos;m here , is an actual experiment . </s>
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter a particular death sentence , say , say , say . </s>
and i see a different pattern that makes you . </s>
and that &apos;s because in the middle of the <unk> here , people are at the edge , and they &apos;re on the <unk> . </s>
we can move one step further and then the data to new and see that they &apos;re new , and they &apos;re not suspect , but cancers are not going to be for everybody . </s>
if we go to age , say , say , say , we see 40 years or younger , we see that accidents even is the most powerful people to worry . </s>
and who &apos;s alarming is that this is particularly true with men . </s>
so , you see that the information is looking at information and data in this way , very smooth in this way . </s>
and if we can &apos;t do this for raw , why not even for content ? </s>
what we &apos;ve now is the <unk> of every single &quot; north <unk> , &quot; which has ever been printed . </s>
it &apos;s all online . it &apos;s all online . </s>
you can test it for my talk to your <unk> . </s>
with <unk> , they can break into a decade . </s>
they can &apos;t provide a specific year . </s>
and you can jump to a specific issue . </s>
now , if i look at this , i see the athlete that &apos;s going to appear in this issue . </s>
i &apos;m a lance fan , so i click the way all expenses into the world that will have mentioned in the arts . </s>
now , if i just want to get a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i &apos;m doing anything to the subject of <unk> ? &quot; </s>
so i go back and <unk> the perspective . </s>
now i see greg <unk> . </s>
and so , you get a idea that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and you don &apos;t just look or not just . </s>
you make something else that &apos;s actually slightly different . </s>
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used information . </s>
i want to continue to be doing this idea , a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit . </s>
what we &apos;ve done here is we have a little bit of a <unk> and they &apos;re looking at a small summary . </s>
the summary contains a quick grip and a symbol for the field of it . </s>
i just show you the top of the <unk> . </s>
but even in this grassland , we can do a lot of things . </s>
immediately we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia . </s>
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of the government . </s>
now after i realize i realize that the <unk> that are the <unk> that are about to be the most likely time talking about the year . </s>
this is really important , there &apos;s a realization that is not in a single frame of life . </s>
this is just too far as you get a step back and all the way . </s>
so , on one of these , the one , i can put on time in the subject of time , &quot; people in the year , &quot; go in the year and all together . </s>
now , if i realize all of these people , i realize that the majority are <unk> , and some of the majority are <unk> , and some of the science , here &apos;s my boss , and here &apos;s my boss . </s>
and interestingly enough , has a ted prize winner . </s>
so we can jump to all ted , <unk> winners . </s>
you see , we &apos;re browsing it in the web the first time it really is a network , not just from side to page , but much more abstract . </s>
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be a little bit . </s>
i &apos;ll just show you just the new york times more powerful times . </s>
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it really isn &apos;t really no browser , but you can look at these <unk> , and we bring these <unk> to each other . </s>
so i can go back to a specific party , and it &apos;s a specific <unk> . </s>
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re just going through the right of the web in this way , and the whole <unk> that are happening in the same way . </s>
so i can zoom in a particular term , in a particular way . </s>
here &apos;s the one of the entire ones i &apos;ve been to do . </s>
and i can say anything i &apos;ve seen today , back to the same way . </s>
and if i reconnect up again , i can take my final new libra , here i have a look at &apos; <unk> &apos; way , here i have to be <unk> &apos; rebel , here &apos;s going to live on . </s>
and from here , i can go back into the side and back . </s>
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s going to be used over and over again , it &apos;s the complete of the complete larger than the sum of the fittest . </s>
right now , we think that data is a curse . </s>
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re talking about the drowning in information . </s>
what if we could turn this situation and the internet on the head , so that we &apos;re always instead of doing instead of a glimpse to a different way , and by a lot of things , and by doing some patterns , which otherwise is hidden ? </s>
if we can do this , then , this is a <unk> , maybe a new source of information . </s>
and just can we get into information , we can get out of the ones . </s>
and if we know , then we may even pull out the <unk> . </s>
so i hear thank you very much . </s>
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction . </s>
in my high school , i went to school , every day one hour a hour of school , every day one hour per square . </s>
and my nose , i had always found in a book , a <unk> that tells my thoughts in other worlds and in <unk> , my deep <unk> to me , <unk> <unk> . </s>
this curiosity , although i was in the school , by the forests <unk> , and &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> , all home , all home , and put it home and put on the microscope . </s>
i was totally <unk> , you know . </s>
it was always about trying to understand the world , and the limits of the potential . </s>
and my love too science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and the deep sea . </s>
jacques cousteau , in our living rooms with his fascinating shows that we &apos;ve had to animals and places and a world full of wonder that we &apos;ve never had before . </s>
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do is really good at the edge of <unk> . </s>
and i was an artist . </s>
i was able to draw . i was able to paint . </s>
and since it &apos;s not video games nor this <unk> film that entire wound in media , i had to make the pictures in my head . </s>
so we had to solve the time , when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and they depend on the screen in our heads . </s>
my response was to draw the drawing and paint with aliens , aliens worlds , robots , <unk> and all of that . </s>
i was constantly being <unk> , like i was a <unk> textbook , <unk> . </s>
and the creativity somehow somehow somehow somehow . </s>
and then there &apos;s something interesting . what would me be called jacques cousteau &apos;s <unk> , was the thought of a group of ourselves on earth on earth . </s>
i would never have to be a real world with a spaceship world , and that seemed really unlikely . </s>
but here was a world i actually could walk on earth , and it was just fascinating and powerful , like all that i was introduced when i read this books . </s>
so i decided to be able to be cut back to become cut . </s>
the only problem was that i was in a small village in canada , one is a <unk> kilometers from the next ocean . </s>
i didn &apos;t know what i &apos;m interested . </s>
i <unk> my dad , until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , right on the other side of the border , where we lived . </s>
i graduated from a pool of <unk> in the winter in the winter in winter , new york . </s>
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later , when we moved to california . </s>
since then , in the 40 years , the results are <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water , 500 of them in <unk> . </s>
and i learned that the world of deep sea , even in the ocean systems , as rich in the ocean realm , is that rich in the ocean realm , how we can &apos;t imagine it really . </s>
the imagination of nature knows no borders , unlike the contrast to our own , <unk> human imagination . </s>
until days i &apos;m doing <unk> , i see the <unk> for what i see on my own . </s>
and my love to the ocean is listening to the same intensity , and the ones . </s>
when i was a profession , it was available . </s>
this seemed to be the best way to get my inner urge , to unite stories with my need to unite . </s>
so as a kid , i drew comic books and so . </s>
so movies of the road , pictures and stories , and stories . </s>
of course , the stories i <unk> out of the <unk> , &quot; aliens &quot; and &quot; aliens &quot; . &quot; </s>
at <unk> , i was going to put my preference for the <unk> and connecting to the body . </s>
so , what my two passions . </s>
something interesting happened to <unk> in this movie : to solve a <unk> problem in this movie -- and we had to make a kind of liquid <unk> , we interfered on <unk> animation , <unk> , back . </s>
what was striking , the first <unk> <unk> that ever was in a movie . </s>
the film , no money , he &apos;s told his own , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like <unk> the magic of the magic . </s>
according to the arthur law , &quot; <unk> technology , not more inclusive of each other . </s>
so they looked at something . </s>
and i found out of this . </s>
and i thought , wow , that &apos;s supposed to be in the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot; </s>
so we went in &quot; the two &quot; the next film , my next film , my next film . </s>
together with <unk> , we put the guy from liquid metal , and the success of the way it was going to be the effect on the effect . </s>
and it worked . and again , we had a magic little bit of the audience . and the effect in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money on the movie . </s>
and from these two experiences , was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> . </s>
so i started a company , along with my good friend , who &apos;s at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> . she was calling digital <unk> . </s>
the idea of this company was to fill out the phase output of visual and the same with the <unk> <unk> . </s>
and then we did that , and we would make us as a proposal . </s>
but the mid- of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we &apos;ve had to do with the company , we had to <unk> <unk> . </s>
i had this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; to the power of the city of visual effects and <unk> effects in the new heights , with the same human rights that were made , and the <unk> should be <unk> . and the <unk> should be <unk> . </s>
but the only thing that &apos;s all the time , quite beautiful , and people in my company told me that we don &apos;t have to be able to do this . </s>
so i got this and made this other film about the big ship that &apos;s been missing . </s>
the <unk> i have that as &quot; romeo and julia , &quot; sold , &quot; sold . it became a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> . </s>
but i wanted to really wanted to understand real heart of the titanic . </s>
that &apos;s what i did the film . </s>
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know what . </s>
i &apos;ve got them , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to dig the cover , and we tend to do the actual business model . </s>
we &apos;re going to show it in the middle of the film . </s>
that &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot; </s>
and i persuaded them to finance a expedition . </s>
it &apos;s crazy . but this is again again , again , that the perfect imagination can create a reality . </s>
and then we created six months later , a reality where i <unk> in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles beneath the surface of the north atlantic , and i &apos;m going to get the actual <unk> of a <unk> . </s>
this was not a movie , no mortal , that was really . </s>
so , that &apos;s actually true . </s>
and the preparation was enormous , we had to go out and all sorts of things and all of these things . </s>
and i realized how much these <unk> , a <unk> plant . </s>
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> . </s>
you get to the capsule , you can go into this dark , <unk> environment , where you &apos;re going down , where you &apos;re not going to go back to yourself . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s really cool . &quot; </s>
i was obsessed with the deep sea . </s>
anyway , the part of curiosity and science , it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it was curiosity . it
and it was a experience that couldn &apos;t abandon me . </s>
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i see outside of the <unk> . </s>
in some of the following , i saw the whole things in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes , even no one had seen anything that i had never seen before , sometimes , when we saw them , sometimes when we saw them , even no words . </s>
so this has really been right me , and i wanted to go more . </s>
and so i got a slightly unusual choice . </s>
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; said , i want to do my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood to ice cream , and i &apos;ll be going to be a <unk> for a time . &quot; </s>
and then we started , we put on the <unk> , and they use them with <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ve been back to the genomics of the titanic . </s>
we took little robots that we built that a <unk> <unk> . </s>
our intention was , <unk> , and the body of the <unk> was going to see what had never been done before . </s>
no one had the inside of the <unk> , you had no tools , so we developed the <unk> technology . </s>
well , i &apos;m sitting here on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is quite a <unk> here , and i know that once the bond was playing there . </s>
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little <unk> by the <unk> of the war . </s>
i just <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle . </s>
it felt like i was physically inside the titanic of the titanic . </s>
this was the <unk> shape of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner of the <unk> , i knew what was going on in the <unk> of the north america , because i was <unk> when we were the film . </s>
the set of the water , the set of the water official was on the official process . </s>
so this was a highly curious experience . </s>
they made me this <unk> , realizing that you use these <unk> <unk> and so the complete conscious to the car , in these other forms of the existence . </s>
and it was really really , really , really , really profound . </s>
and maybe a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the thing that might happen in some decades , if you have to have a <unk> to do something about what i can imagine as a celebration of a <unk> . </s>
after these , we began what we saw underneath the bottom , really appreciate what we saw , for example , this is an incredibly powerful animals , where we saw these incredibly powerful animals , and that &apos;s a little alien , but here on earth . </s>
they live with help . </s>
they weren &apos;t in a way sunlight , how we do that . </s>
and so you see , animals , that directly , right next to a 500 degree centigrade , they can survive . </s>
at the same time , i was interested in <unk> , which was the back of the <unk> of my childhood . </s>
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and the mit , and in the <unk> , and they &apos;re sitting right now and right to the <unk> , and they drive to russia , and they drive to russia , and they drive to the international <unk> and take our <unk> . </s>
that was fascinating . </s>
but at the end , it was going to be told that i took us into the deep sea . </s>
i took them with and <unk> them to the world , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people who are interested in the way that they were interested in the sources of such a social , i took them on , take a look and instruments and so on . </s>
we were in the fact , but actually science , more specifically , and more specifically , <unk> . </s>
so when the circle of my existence , as a kid , and the implementation in reality . </s>
and in the course of that , i learned a lot of learning . </s>
i learned a lot about science , but i think they certainly think , a director must be able to have a leader , a leader like a <unk> or something . </s>
i don &apos;t mind much of leadership , before i was this <unk> . </s>
because i was to say , &quot; what do i do here ? &quot; what do i do ? </s>
why do i do this ? what does it matter ? &quot; </s>
these <unk> films will bring us a money . </s>
we &apos;re just trying to play the little bit . </s>
all think of it , between &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have been given to the <unk> somewhere on the beach . </s>
i &apos;ve all these films , this one , for a very small audience . </s>
no honor , no money . what do you do ? </s>
you &apos;re doing it to the task of the challenge to get on -- and the ocean is the most powerful environment that are the most powerful environment , and because of the ocean is the most curious , because of the <unk> , if a small group of people a team . </s>
because we &apos;ve been all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been in the years , sometimes we have two to three months back on top of us . </s>
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the creation of the destruction that you have to do is because you can &apos;t explain any other thing . </s>
if you &apos;re going to drill on land and say , &quot; we &apos;ve had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the difficulty , the <unk> , if you &apos;re going to be able to do that , that &apos;s like police or soldiers , who have been doing some of you and know that they never can explain
there &apos;s a connection , a <unk> . </s>
so when i was to turn my next film , &quot; avatar &quot; avatar , i tried to make your leadership , which is that you &apos;re looking for more comfortable and then they deserves in the <unk> . </s>
and so , really changed the dynamics . </s>
so , i was going to be back with a little team on a small team , and we were doing &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that has never been before . </s>
so exciting . </s>
a big challenge . </s>
and we were asked for a time of four years to a right family . </s>
so , it changed my way , films , completely . </s>
there were people who used , we would have this <unk> , and on the planet , we would have grown back to the planet . </s>
for me , it was more a more nuanced way of thinking about my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome . </s>
so what can we do with all of you ? </s>
what we learned about ? </s>
i think there &apos;s curiosity . </s>
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature . </s>
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality . </s>
and the architect of your team is more important than the world &apos;s greenest in this world . </s>
to me , young , give me a advice , i can ask me a advice , like i can do something like i could do this . &quot; </s>
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you own yourself . </s>
this will be true for you . don &apos;t you get yourself , not against himself . it &apos;s take himself . </s>
the nasa has this one : &quot; fail is not a alternative . &quot; </s>
but in art , and yet , there &apos;s no alternative an alternative , because there &apos;s going to be a <unk> . </s>
not a big deal , the innovation of innovation , was ever addressed . </s>
you have to be ready to take that . </s>
so this is the idea that i would like to give you one to the way , but fail is a choice , fear , fear , fear is a choice , fear , fear is not . thank you . </s>
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate . </s>
and perhaps , maybe something that &apos;s because my <unk> is mostly in the foundation to make vaccines and herbicides and air quality to make the poorest two of the world , we have to make a better life . </s>
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone on the planet . </s>
<unk> means that their <unk> are not growing , and we &apos;re going to change too much or too few of it , and they will change their fragile environments . </s>
it leads to <unk> . it &apos;s going to lead to the earth . </s>
so , will be a realistic component for you . </s>
and also the key thing is to be very important . </s>
and the fact is that if you could reduce the price , the price of savings might reduce the price , the <unk> will be the energy for the most part . </s>
now , the <unk> is over time . </s>
in fact , the <unk> is <unk> on <unk> . </s>
the <unk> are the industrial revolution in the 20th century , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> in the 20th century , and therefore we have refrigerators , we can make modern materials and so many things . </s>
so we &apos;re finding ourselves in a beautiful situation in the rich world . </s>
but if we reduce the prize -- let &apos;s let &apos;s take the prize up to the prize -- we meet a new barrier and this barrier of co2 together . </s>
co2 makes the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear . </s>
they squirt co2 , which is <unk> and these <unk> , and maybe worse , the <unk> of the <unk> that the natural ecosystems , they can &apos;t adjust the <unk> , and all sorts of systems . </s>
well , the exact look at the exact exact same relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> black-and-white and where the other is now , there &apos;s some of them , but not a lot of them . </s>
and there are certainly that these are going to be the following , but they &apos;re extremely bad at bad ! </s>
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> , &quot; we really need to get down to zero ? </s>
isn &apos;t the half or a quarter ? &quot; </s>
the answer is : we get close to zero , the temperature will continue . </s>
so it &apos;s a big challenge . </s>
it &apos;s quite different than to say , we have a 3.5 foot at a three foot , which is a three foot , and then it &apos;s got to be the beginning of the face . </s>
this is a little bit down to the bottom , on a zero . </s>
now , we &apos;re entering a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons . </s>
each americans about 20 tons . people are dying of poor countries than a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s about five tons of five tons of the planet . </s>
and somehow we have to make changes that it &apos;s going to be able to get on a zero . </s>
it &apos;s so far anywhere . </s>
only different economic changes have affected that even more and we have to go from <unk> to the top , and to zero one of them . </s>
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a multiplication , and they have this thing about the number of people , of the african that every human energy is able to bring the average energy for everybody , and the co2 that &apos;s going to be able to be a <unk> . </s>
so let &apos;s look at this thing , and we think about how we get this to zero . </s>
probably one has to come up with this numbers of going on . </s>
now , this is fundamental algebra , but we &apos;ll just take it through . </s>
first we have the population . </s>
today , <unk> billion people , and today , <unk> people , <unk> . </s>
and there &apos;s an entire nine billion base of the nine billion more quickly networks . </s>
if we could find a lot of new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could bleed that for 10 percent or the time , but we see a slope to see a slope . </s>
the second factor are the services we use . </s>
that includes all the food we eat , clothes , television , television , is . </s>
these are very good things and <unk> , these services almost every time to make any other day . </s>
it &apos;s great that this number one is . </s>
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could make more inclusive and less , but in the average , this is the number of the services , the number of services are going to be more than the ones that number the services of services . </s>
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s too much light that you can read the homework ? </s>
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read your <unk> underneath the <unk> . </s>
well , in efficiency , the power of the energy is a service , there &apos;s been good news . </s>
we have something that doesn &apos;t look like , you know , it &apos;s not increasing . </s>
because of different successes in the <unk> , in other spectral ways , through new methods , there are lots of services , their numbers , whose rate are going to drop a few percent more productive . </s>
in other ways , like the <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> : <unk> or <unk> , is <unk> , or <unk> , is the way that &apos;s very much smaller . </s>
and so , we get a factor , maybe even a factor , maybe a factor , maybe a factor , maybe a factor of six , or maybe even a factor of six of the conventional plan . </s>
but the first three factors , we went from 26 billion tons of <unk> , and that &apos;s not enough of the box . and not from the jury . </s>
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this will be a piece of the material -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be a amount of co2 that will be a <unk> . </s>
it turns out whether you can get it on a zero . </s>
if you burn it , no . </s>
if you burn a natural gas : no . </s>
almost every drug technologies for electricity today is co2 , except renewables and <unk> . </s>
so what we need to do is to create a global scale , is to create a new system . </s>
we need <unk> . </s>
now , if i use the phrase &quot; miracle , i don &apos;t use the impossible , i don &apos;t mean . </s>
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle . </s>
the internet and the service is a miracle . </s>
people here have this miracle to be affected here . </s>
and usually there &apos;s no deadline to have a miracle to date to a certain date . </s>
and then you just moved around and some people , others don &apos;t . </s>
in this case , we have to give you a miracle and miracle in a very short time . </s>
well , i wondered how could i really get this ? </s>
is a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of people here ? </s>
i remembered last year , when i was a painting , and i liked a little bit of people . </s>
the idea was really , you know , there are people who live with mosquito . </s>
for the energy i &apos;m a little bit . </s>
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies my <unk> , the way to the environment . </s>
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies . </s>
you have noticed that they don &apos;t bite , but they &apos;re not going to leave the glass . </s>
now , there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> like this , but they &apos;re all wrong . </s>
we need solutions , either one or a bunch of a unimaginable , and some of the unimaginable have been , and yet there are many ways that i really want to look for , i really just look for five to do these big demands . </s>
i &apos;ve got some of the <unk> , <unk> and biofuels . </s>
and so , that may be a <unk> and if you &apos;re better than i expect , the great , but my <unk> , is that we have to give them because they &apos;re teaching us because they all have problems , because all of us have problems . </s>
let &apos;s look at first , we &apos;re going to look at the burning fossil fuels , burning oil . </s>
what you need to do is just easy to just , but it &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that is coming from the <unk> , and then somewhere somewhere , and then somewhere somewhere and hoping that there &apos;s going to be there . </s>
there are some <unk> that that &apos;s been on a 60 percent , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get a 60 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult challenge , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> . </s>
who &apos;s going to make sure ? </s>
who can do something that literally higher than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ? </s>
this is a lot of the volume . </s>
so this is a tough nut . </s>
next : <unk> . </s>
they also have three big issues . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , and the question is , the question of security , that you really feel nothing wrong , despite human sensing that the fuel is not going to use . </s>
and do you do that the waste ? </s>
because it &apos;s not very big , it &apos;s a lot of concerns . </s>
so three of the hard problems that might be more soluble , and they &apos;re working on . </s>
the last three of five years . </s>
it &apos;s the renewables of the renewables , as they called . </s>
and i &apos;ve got the ones -- although it &apos;s great , you don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some drawbacks . </s>
one is the appropriate that are dramatically beneficial than the ones of <unk> . </s>
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about lots of junk , and makes a normal power plant . </s>
and also , this vent is to be the same vent . </s>
the sun doesn &apos;t get the whole day , not every day , and also the other people are not constantly adjusting . </s>
so if you have to be about this sources , you have to have a way , but it &apos;s also available to get energy in times when it &apos;s not available . </s>
there &apos;s big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission , if we say , for example , the fact outside the country , they don &apos;t just have the technology , they have to deal with the risk of where energy are from the way . </s>
and there &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all kinds of batteries , the <unk> , the <unk> , the world , the world , <unk> , the <unk> , the world , <unk> , the <unk> , which we could now make less than 10 minutes of the <unk> . </s>
we need a big breakthrough , something that &apos;s going to be 100 , than the <unk> to the time . </s>
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy . </s>
what happens when you try to say this <unk> sources of say we have 20 percent of the human kingdom . </s>
if you want to have 100 percent of what they want to have a incredible <unk> . </s>
now where we &apos;re going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ? </s>
a &quot; ? &quot; how do we get to target ? </s>
what we need is many of the companies that work in . </s>
every one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . </s>
so many people will say , they &apos;re crazy . </s>
i think there &apos;s lots of the ted group there , there &apos;s a lot of things that there is . </s>
bill two , has several companies , among other things , among <unk> <unk> has great <unk> . </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in dozens of companies that do amazing things and interesting ways to support trying to support that . </s>
nathan myhrvold and i &apos;ve been funding , maybe , that , as far , the jewish approach . </s>
there &apos;s some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> . </s>
so the evolution has a long time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts . </s>
the dmca means that you are instead of a part of the <unk> , which one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent of burning , the <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea . </s>
but actually , you had been thinking about this , but you couldn &apos;t see it , but you couldn &apos;t see if it would work , but since then there &apos;s been found that , yes ! it would be like , but with the right <unk> , it looks like that . </s>
and because you &apos;re blowing this 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better . </s>
in fact , you get the waste , and you can even use the waste switch by the waste as a <unk> . </s>
instead of being <unk> , they burn it out , and a great thing . </s>
the uranium is becoming a little bit of a candle . </s>
you see that there &apos;s a kind of entertainment , often than &quot; open wave . &quot; </s>
the evidence is really the <unk> . </s>
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky . </s>
this is the waste that 99 percent of the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that is burned today , <unk> , so it &apos;s <unk> uranium . </s>
this is the u.s. for hundreds of years . </s>
and if you take inexpensive <unk> and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet . </s>
you know , there &apos;s many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward . </s>
let &apos;s think we should measure our success . </s>
how should we look like our testimony ? </s>
now , let &apos;s go to the goal , we &apos;re going to reach , and then we talk about the <unk> . </s>
many people spend about 80 percent reduction in 2050 . </s>
it &apos;s really important that we get there . </s>
the rest of 20 percent are going to be squeezed , and still , and they &apos;re still going to be <unk> , and they &apos;ll clean it up and fall out of it . </s>
so , this 80 percent , to reach this 80 percent , the industrialized ones , including countries like china , their <unk> completely completely . </s>
the other note say whether we use the <unk> technology , whether they &apos;re used in all evolved , and we &apos;re heading on the way to get them . </s>
that &apos;s great important . </s>
this is going to be a <unk> of this <unk> . </s>
if we go back to the end of the <unk> ? </s>
it should contain two of the elements . </s>
we should use the <unk> to bring to the way , as we get <unk> , the more likely to be the <unk> , and it &apos;s also the temperature . </s>
but actually , this note for the things we &apos;re doing business , which is just just a bit less important , just , or even less important , which is the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs . </s>
we have to chase this breakthroughs , we have to chase with <unk> and we can measure it : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this subject . </s>
the al gore book book , &quot; we have the choice and david <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , the <unk> air . &quot; </s>
they &apos;re really going to go through and create a framework where this is true going to be able to do , because we need to make it for it to all of the sides . </s>
there &apos;s some things to be . </s>
this is a wish . </s>
a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
if you just ask me wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i would choose this wish , which is , the answer is <unk> without co2 , which is <unk> <unk> . </s>
this has the greatest impact . </s>
if we get this desire to not get between the <unk> and mixed people , between the united states and rich and rich and the rich and rich and almost all of these lives will be much worse in the two of worse . </s>
so what do we need to do ? </s>
for those of the things i do ? </s>
we need to do more carefully . </s>
if countries like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 . </s>
they should be <unk> , and they would be shocked to the rare slope that are going to be <unk> for those innovative approaches . </s>
we need <unk> , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; it &apos;s something that a <unk> is going to be a <unk> . </s>
we need to spread the message . </s>
we need to have some dialogue and we lead the things that are going to be undertaken by government . </s>
it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can fulfill it . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . thank you . </s>
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- but we can give us a glimpse of scale on this investment ? </s>
bill gates : to get the simulation in a grandmaster , all the great scientists , what we did , we need a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s really reasonable , you &apos;re just going to go into the <unk> . </s>
the hard step of the first step is the first <unk> , the <unk> and the place of the actual actual world &apos;s first benefit . </s>
once the first is ready when it &apos;s like , as it goes on , it &apos;s all clear , and then all right , because the <unk> is so different than in the <unk> , as we know them . </s>
and to understand the right thing : that means deep deep molecules into the ground almost like a vertical column , this can grow and then start off the process , and the process goes down and working on the bottom line . </s>
<unk> : right now , you have to rethink the reactor &apos;s reactor , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of monitoring that can be wrong , and things like that , you can see things , and that &apos;s not good . </s>
if you &apos;re very cheap fuel , you can think about it for 60 years -- think of a column -- they were able to bury it without all the salts . </s>
and it &apos;s sitting there and burns 60 years and then it &apos;s ready . </s>
a <unk> , which appears to be a solution for the garbage . </s>
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the trash , you can do it , and you can do it , there &apos;s much less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it on . </s>
and we begin to take the waste that is that it &apos;s already in these <unk> or <unk> in the reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> . </s>
so what &apos;s going to be a problem of the problem , what we &apos;ve ever found in our diet , and it &apos;s going to dramatically reduce the <unk> dramatically during this process . </s>
but while you &apos;ve been talking about different people in this world , and while you &apos;ve talked about this opportunity , and while you &apos;ve been talking about this opportunity , and while you &apos;ve been talking about this opportunity , and while you &apos;ve been talking about this opportunity , and while you &apos;ve been talking about this opportunity , and while you &apos;ve been talking about this
where is the largest interest in the world , so what really was going on ? </s>
<unk> : now we &apos;re not going to have a place and there &apos;s lots of interesting doses of everything that is called &quot; nuclear &quot; <unk> &quot; -- i was here and i &apos;ve talked about it here , and i talked about it , and i talked about it , like this . </s>
i &apos;m optimistic about , you know , the french and the japanese have something in the direction . </s>
this is a nuance that was done . </s>
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster , and some countries have this built , so everyone has a <unk> , which is anyone that has a <unk> <unk> for our first time . </s>
and in your mind , is that in the probability of that , is a little bit of the life ? </s>
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have spent 20 years to the <unk> and then 20 years . </s>
that &apos;s basically the ones that we have the <unk> of the <unk> that we have to do . </s>
and , you know , <unk> , when everything is , and that &apos;s a big wish , it might keep easy . </s>
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies , as if their commitments work , the <unk> for their pilots . </s>
and it would be the best way to do it , because then you could use a mixture of use . </s>
so we need a solution to each case . </s>
so , the big idea , is this the largest thing that you know ? </s>
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important . </s>
that would be so much more important . </s>
in the nuclear sector there are other animal companies . </s>
you know , we don &apos;t know how much of these , but there are the modular approach , that &apos;s another approach . </s>
there &apos;s a <unk> , which seems something hard to , but maybe say that , let &apos;s say that . </s>
and so there &apos;s a different , but the beauty of this is that a <unk> has a lot of energy , so say , a <unk> and so , if you can avoid a much energy , say , a <unk> and therefore , if you can avoid a much energy , say , a <unk> and therefore , the effect that is , almost in a different way
if that doesn &apos;t work what ? </s>
we have to keep <unk> to keep the <unk> stable , to keep the <unk> stable . </s>
<unk> : if you get to a situation , it &apos;s more likely to be eating , and just a heart valve , what do you do you want to do ? you need a <unk> or a couple of times . </s>
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is , to delay the warming , so we have 20 or 30 years longer to us . </s>
this is just a <unk> . </s>
you hope that we don &apos;t need . </s>
some people say , you should not only work on insurance , because you &apos;re going to work with a self , so that you eat , you know , because you know that one is saving . </s>
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you look at the centrality of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> that you should have to have to have the other way , if things come faster , or that innovation is going faster than we expect . </s>
<unk> : did you have a or two sentences for the ones to persuade you ? </s>
<unk> : well , unfortunately , life is the <unk> in very different camps . </s>
those who are very little . </s>
say that there are better effects that have to do with the clouds , the things that we have ? </s>
there &apos;s very , very few things that you can say , that &apos;s one of them in a million . </s>
the <unk> here is so much like aids . </s>
you make the mistake now , and you create a lot later . </s>
and so the idea of what &apos;s now going to be now , if you &apos;ve all got to invest all the possible problems that you start to invest in something that you start to invest in the rich world , which you start to see -- and to say that the fact that the investment is not so clear and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us . </s>
but my dream here is that if you can do it , and then the same time they &apos;re concerned , then they say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m almost like , but the same time they arrive , then they &apos;ll be the same thing , but i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot; </s>
and so , their response to the <unk> was that if you all that time and energy to solve co2 , all the other goals , the <unk> , the power of co2 , money , money , money , money , for the better things we can do . </s>
<unk> : well , the actual <unk> of research -- say , we should spend the u.s. for 10 billion more than a year today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic . </s>
it doesn &apos;t suffer other things . </s>
you get to large <unk> , and here &apos;s a reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not really economically , and trying to finance that , for me , the waste here is most . </s>
it &apos;s a very short thing , and i think , is the more short of the time i do more things that the potential to be much more cheaper . </s>
if the <unk> that you get , a very high high school teacher , then just the rich in the rich . </s>
i mean , each of us here could spend five times so much for our energy without its lifestyle . </s>
for the lower two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster . </s>
and even more <unk> . </s>
his new <unk> is : &quot; why not the research isn &apos;t going to do ? &quot; </s>
he &apos;s still going to be still , because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he has understood that that &apos;s a very lonely group , and therefore it is now that it &apos;s going to be the <unk> . </s>
and this is a state that i think for the appropriate . </s>
so , the research , it &apos;s just nuts , how little things are . </s>
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk about , for almost everybody , i hope you really will be true , thank you very much . </s>
<unk> : thank you . </s>
a few years ago , peter <unk> called &quot; the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot; </s>
the idea is quite simple . <unk> <unk> structure with 20 degrees of reference , about a <unk> and a marshmallow , about a <unk> thread and a marshmallow . </s>
the marshmallow is going to be on . </s>
and , even though it really just really easy , it &apos;s really hard to do it because it &apos;s going to do very quickly . </s>
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i thought it was a <unk> . </s>
it was a big success . </s>
and then i took about 70 , 70 , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and the architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> and the way i want to share with you . </s>
so , most people have to start to look at the task of the task . </s>
they talk about how it will look like , it &apos;s <unk> to power , power , to make power . </s>
then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they &apos;re open to the spaghetti box . </s>
you &apos;re investing up a lot of their time in the <unk> constantly structures structures structures . </s>
and then finally , shortly before you have no time , take a look and put it gently gently on the top , you put it on the top , and &quot; <unk> &quot; ! &quot; you use your work . </s>
but almost always , is almost always , is that the <unk> is going to be a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is the whole thing is to add and <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s a bunch of people who have much more <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> in the worst <unk> . </s>
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> . </s>
and of course , there are lots of more <unk> , and there &apos;s been the best ones in the process of the <unk> . </s>
and that &apos;s quite amazing . </s>
as we &apos;ve got the highest , they &apos;re not just the highest , but the most interesting structures of all of all . </s>
what you might ask is : how does this come ? why ? what is that i mean ? </s>
and peter tells you , &quot; neither of the children are being <unk> in the <unk> of the spaghetti sauce . </s>
they don &apos;t invest time . </s>
there &apos;s another reason to do . </s>
and that <unk> were being trained to find a real plan , ok , ok ! </s>
and then i decided to realize . </s>
what happens when you put the marshmallow on top of the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ? </s>
it &apos;s a crisis . </s>
is what ? </s>
what is more aware that they are going to come with the marshmallow and build prototypes , is successful prototypes , so they &apos;re expecting to be able to fix them into fixing conventional prototypes . </s>
<unk> is this kind of collaboration than a core of a <unk> . </s>
and then , with each other , the kids get consumers feedback feedback and what doesn &apos;t . </s>
so the performance that we work with prototypes , much more -- but look , look , look like different teams . </s>
the average for most of the average , they &apos;ve been creating a half of them , <unk> , half of them , or lawyers , that &apos;s more , but not much more , more than adults . </s>
who &apos;s the most successful ? </s>
architects and engineers , thankfully . </s>
and i &apos;m the highest thing i &apos;ve seen . </s>
and why ? because they understand , and <unk> are geometric patterns of the key to build structures . </s>
and then there &apos;s something about average , but there &apos;s what it &apos;s interesting . </s>
you &apos;re a <unk> administrator , they &apos;ll be significant and significant . </s>
it &apos;s amazing . you see it to be around and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot; </s>
you can predict that , why is that ? </s>
because they have special skills of the <unk> . </s>
they conduct the process , they understand him . </s>
and this team that regulates the performance and the work of work , the performance will improve the performance . </s>
and i can also skills and <unk> and their <unk> . </s>
if you have 10 teams that &apos;s going to be a very brief , you get about six , you get about the most stable structure . </s>
i was trying to do something . </s>
i thought we &apos;ll just go to the <unk> . </s>
so i offered a $ price for the winner . </s>
what do you think about this <unk> ? </s>
what was the result ? </s>
this was happening . i didn &apos;t have a team of the structure . </s>
if you had a high high high school , he would have been worn home . </s>
so is it not interesting that high levels have got a strong effect ? </s>
we were just taking these exercise students . </s>
what do you think they happened ? </s>
now the benefit of the world is &quot; the world . &quot; </s>
so from the same , bad team of one among the best . </s>
they are the highest construction in the least . </s>
there are <unk> lessons for us to talk about nature and success . </s>
you may ask : why would you actually have time to create a biosignature ? </s>
the reason i want to use digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
and what the <unk> does is to identify them assumptions to identify them . </s>
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow . </s>
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , using a common language , the right prototype . </s>
and this is the most dramatic exercise of the experience , this simple exercise . </s>
and those of you who are interested in , <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s a solar system there . </s>
they &apos;re showing up crazy examples of the world , like people to optimize the system and <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s also <unk> . </s>
and the <unk> lesson , i think , the construction is actually a <unk> sport . </s>
it demands that we all have to do our senses on the task of task , and we think that we think we &apos;re thinking about how our feelings and our own , in the challenge that we &apos;re going to have . </s>
and sometimes a little prototype of experience everything it needs us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
and that can make a big difference . </s>
thank you . </s>
do we have a machine , and we would do this machine , we would have a machine , and we would have a machine , and we would have a machine . </s>
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time . </s>
and everybody in this room has to come in this room . </s>
and you can go into the past , you can go in here , you can &apos;t go in here and now stay in the past , you &apos;re going to stay in here . </s>
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve been asked my friends in last time , and they wanted to go to the past . </s>
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time , before it was cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s &quot; america . &quot; </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
i &apos;m confident that you &apos;re sort of <unk> to <unk> , <unk> . </s>
and i understand . </s>
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say . </s>
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a adventurers banker -- i &apos;m a adventurers banker . </s>
it &apos;s because of that , you &apos;re going forward to them , they go forward . </s>
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future . </s>
this is the most powerful time that the ones that have ever been on the planet , no matter what scale , wealth , wealth , wealth , <unk> , declining . </s>
there was never one time like this . </s>
my <unk> had all the time they were in the 60 . </s>
my grandparents were on the <unk> , this number of <unk> , this number of <unk> . </s>
my parents are the 80 ones on the <unk> . </s>
so , there should be a child at the beginning of my <unk> . </s>
but it &apos;s not even more people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that . </s>
a child that today in the bay is , expecting to live in the world like the richest man in the world 100 years ago . </s>
think about it . this is an unbelievable fact . </s>
and why is this ? </s>
smallpox . smallpox smallpox billion people on this planet . </s>
they have the demographics of the earth in a way , like no war . </s>
they are gone . they &apos;re gone . </s>
we &apos;ve got them <unk> . </s>
in the rich world , the million people are still going to have a generation of the generation that are still threatened by us . </s>
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ... </s>
even somebody who &apos;s this ? </s>
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed , billion people , that are the animal of scientific method . </s>
and from my view , the scientific method , things that it works , it works , it &apos;s going to change it , one of the greatest achievement of humanity . </s>
so this is the good news . </s>
unfortunately , this is the good news , because there are some other problems , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> . </s>
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in this world every day . </s>
this is the number , and they &apos;re looking at very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing . </s>
and not just that , we have used to think of our world &apos;s world . </s>
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas , gas , gas , gas , and we don &apos;t disappear it from that chaos . </s>
so the question is , can we do that ? i &apos;ve already been doing this . </s>
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food , the billion people will feed without the land that they live . </s>
i think we can &apos;t provide energy that they don &apos;t do at the same time . </s>
i really think that &apos;s not a <unk> . </s>
but this is where you &apos;re sitting at night -- one of the things that worries me night at night , and we &apos;ve never been teaching scientific progress as now as we &apos;ve never been so concerned about now , no way , no way , yet , in fact , we &apos;ve never been doing before . </s>
and we were also able to do it , as we can now do it today . </s>
we &apos;re on the cusp of the cusp , amazing events on a lot of other things , and yet i really think that we &apos;re going to go back to a time , 300 years ago , where we &apos;ve been doing things back in the world , we &apos;ve been <unk> , more than now . </s>
people have committed to their faith , and that &apos;s so tightly that you can &apos;t free . </s>
not even the truth , they will free . </s>
and you &apos;re looking at his view , even a very right to his view , to get on the progress , to get on the progress of progress . </s>
but you know what they haven &apos;t got right ? </s>
they don &apos;t have a right to your own facts , &apos; , not , don &apos;t have them . </s>
and i &apos;ve got a time to find out . </s>
so a decade ago , i &apos;ve written a paper about ted , &quot; written a small article . </s>
and i was astonished to resistance on resistance , on resistance , what is the most effective part of the most effective part of humanity in the history of mankind . </s>
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i always wrote on , and i wrote a paper and went ahead . </s>
and soon i wrote a paper about the <unk> food . </s>
the same thing , just greater . </s>
and people were playing crazy . </s>
so i wrote a paper about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that the molecules were going to be , why would that be , &quot; <unk> &quot; , why would that be , in a particular way , rather than a <unk> of nature , in nature . </s>
but you know , i &apos;m doing what i do . i wrote the article , i kept . </s>
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist . </s>
we type rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay . </s>
but that paper would be worried , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and i found it out . </s>
and that &apos;s because these people who were crazy crazy with me . </s>
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people . </s>
they were just like the people in this room . </s>
and that &apos;s what made me so confused , and that &apos;s what it was like , &quot; i have this kind of mess ... so confused . </s>
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s face it , let &apos;s face it , &quot; we &apos;re honest . </s>
we &apos;ve gone to a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio to progress . </s>
we &apos;re talking about it . </s>
we talk about the <unk> , with small quotes , &quot; progress . &quot; </s>
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what causes reasons . </s>
we &apos;ve seen the trust in the institutions , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that &apos;s not supposed to be . </s>
you can call some names and people will understand . </s>
nobel <unk> , <unk> , weapons , weapons , weapons , weapons , the <unk> fisheries . </s>
i mean , you can choose your own list . </s>
there are questions and problems that we believed that they were always right . </s>
ask , ask them evidence , providing <unk> . </s>
take nothing like granted . </s>
but now it &apos;s : if you get the evidence to accept these evidence , and we &apos;re not doing good at all right . </s>
and i can say that from the reason we &apos;ve never seen this , as i haven &apos;t seen anything before . </s>
about 12 years ago , a terrible story that was published the <unk> of the day , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine in relation to them . </s>
yeah . </s>
in fact , in fact , there were about whether that was the thing . </s>
now , in fact , there are a serious issue . </s>
the data came up . </s>
the data came out from the united states , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , <unk> , no connection . </s>
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in the anecdotes , we think what is to see what makes you feel , what do we feel really feel . </s>
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents on a <unk> , which gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do . </s>
but you know what ? </s>
the result of it was devastating , and the result of it was devastating . </s>
and the <unk> of this is the only countries in the world , in which the easter run for the previous inch . </s>
that &apos;s <unk> , and we should be ashamed . </s>
it &apos;s awful . </s>
what is happening that we could do that . </s>
well , i understand that . i do . </s>
because they were presented ? </s>
have a single person in the audience ever die ? </s>
it &apos;s not very often . </s>
it &apos;s not happening in this country , but in fact , in the last year , in the last year . </s>
these are many deaths in the middle of the day , 20 per hour . </s>
but because this isn &apos;t happening here , we can take it out of denial , and people like the jenny , and we can predict the jenny and see illusory and <unk> from platforms like the <unk> live live . </s>
and they can make them because they don &apos;t use the cause and the correlation . </s>
they don &apos;t understand that these things are going to be equal to be equal to be , but almost never , are almost never the same . </s>
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quickly . </s>
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> . </s>
he <unk> us from one of the worst human history . </s>
no fear , <unk> , <unk> , gone . </s>
the guy in the middle is not so much . </s>
he &apos;s called paul <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s got a few other people in a <unk> . </s>
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world . </s>
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ? </s>
now , this is good , except that paul &apos;s own thumb and talk about vaccines and talk about vaccines and say , how are they are , and that people just stop trying to stop . </s>
and that tells you this . </s>
paul is a terrorist . </s>
if paul in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t talk without any <unk> of life . </s>
he gets to home , because people loved him to tell you that his children go to school . </s>
and why ? because paul had made a vaccine . </s>
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines . </s>
take it to the <unk> diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right . </s>
we &apos;ve been now in this country now . </s>
and this is worse , and pretty soon , kids will die over the same way , because that &apos;s just one question of numbers . </s>
and they &apos;re not just going to die . </s>
what &apos;s wrong ? let &apos;s suppose that . why not ? </s>
i wrote a <unk> of mine in a couple of weeks , and i told you to be a little bit of <unk> . </s>
no one has said that before . </s>
they wouldn &apos;t vaccinate their child , not in a case . </s>
fine . </s>
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> , and you know what ? </s>
we had no <unk> in this country . </s>
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe you &apos;re in lagos , in lagos , and flies , right after los angeles , right now . </s>
and in a few hours , he &apos;s a car , and he &apos;s coming to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit this <unk> <unk> tonight . </s>
and he knows that he &apos;s a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is how it works now . </s>
this is the planet , we &apos;re living , don &apos;t pretend that it &apos;s not . </s>
we love to lie in the lab , we love this . </s>
do they have a vitamins of <unk> ? </s>
<unk> , a little <unk> that will help you on the ground . </s>
i know you &apos;ve made that , because half of americans that make it every day . </s>
they take the stuff , and they take alternative , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they are useless . </s>
the data is the time . </s>
they &apos;re eating their urine . they do almost never . </s>
this is okay , you want to pay billions of dollars for dark data . </s>
i agree with you . </s>
dark . dark . </s>
why do we do that ? why do we do this ? </s>
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug . </s>
we hate to a strong government . we don &apos;t have a trust . </s>
and we should not be able to do it . our health system is . </s>
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people . </s>
it &apos;s amazing to us that they can afford to afford . </s>
so we run out , and where we can &apos;t run out ? </s>
we run into the poor . </s>
this is great . i love the <unk> . </s>
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars . </s>
and i &apos;ve all kinds of little pieces here . </s>
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , and , in fact , <unk> , because i don &apos;t know what that , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars , it &apos;s gone . </s>
and you know what ? if i say that , people ask me to people , &quot; what do you do it ? let &apos;s do what they want . </s>
feel good . &quot; </s>
and you know what ? they have wrong . </s>
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to call the asking my point to mammography &quot; or any <unk> to treat his patients with <unk> . </s>
if you &apos;re going to go to these path , and magic <unk> , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be . </s>
they get into south africa . </s>
he &apos;s got 400,000 his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more efficient than two drugs are we know that they can help the course of aids . </s>
hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country , the worse than any other one of these illness is becoming a disease . </s>
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . </s>
they have . they &apos;ve always been . they &apos;ve always been . </s>
now the <unk> epidemic we &apos;re in the right now is this kind of struggle between the <unk> of the <unk> , food and the <unk> . </s>
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop . </s>
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor . </s>
this is ideology , not science . </s>
all we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch , every branch , every branch , every branch , every branch , all of the people . </s>
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise . </s>
there was no <unk> . </s>
there was no <unk> . we did it all . </s>
we &apos;ve done it in the last several years . </s>
and some of them have worked and things don &apos;t . </s>
we are not what &apos;s not worked . </s>
now we can take it more , and of course , we have a lot of risks . but we can do something like vitamin a year , and that &apos;s what can help millions of people , and then they can help , people , their lives . </s>
don &apos;t want to do it ? </s>
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand . </s>
we &apos;re rejecting a <unk> food . </s>
why do we do that ? </s>
now , what i &apos;m suggesting is : too , many chemicals , pesticides , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want to have a huge fields of a thing that &apos;s wrong . </s>
we don &apos;t want to live in business . </s>
we don &apos;t want to have in business . </s>
and you know what my answer is in all this ? </s>
yeah , you know , we &apos;re fine . </s>
it &apos;s true , we have a huge trademark system , but that &apos;s not science . </s>
that has nothing to do with science . </s>
it &apos;s fairly , morality , morality . </s>
you know that science is not a company . </s>
it &apos;s not a country . </s>
she &apos;s not a idea ; it &apos;s a process . </s>
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes , but the idea that we don &apos;t allow science and not yet , but the idea that we don &apos;t need science is a real , and it holds millions of people from the ages . </s>
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to 70 percent more food than 70 percent . 70 percent . </s>
this investment in africa in the last 30 years . </s>
embarrassing . </s>
they need it , and we don &apos;t give it to them . </s>
and why ? caused food . </s>
we don &apos;t want people to eat the <unk> stuff like this , for example . </s>
and the other thing is something that one billion people are eating . </s>
it &apos;s about like a potato . </s>
it &apos;s just a <unk> calories . it &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
it has no nutrients , it &apos;s not a protein , and scientists are building all this in this . </s>
and then they could eat the people who are eating and not being addressed . </s>
they would not starve and you know what ? </s>
this would be nice . it would be nice to be <unk> , but it would be nice . </s>
and all i can say , why do we fight this , and why do we fight this ? </s>
i mean , ask : why do we fight this ? </s>
because we don &apos;t want to be genes ? </s>
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemical . </s>
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our food , food foods , no food . </s>
it &apos;s not about the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about people alive , and it &apos;s going to be at the time , understand what that means . </s>
because you know what ? </s>
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do that , we do something about it , we don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech . </s>
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on . </s>
it &apos;s hard , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our interests , and we have to really stop this . </s>
so after this incredibly funny , you want to say , &quot; you want to go into those ridiculous and go into the future ? &quot; </s>
anyway . i want to be definitely anyway . </s>
right now , in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity . </s>
we can look at this time , what we want to do . </s>
we can put them together , where we want to go to them , and we &apos;ll move them to move into where we want . </s>
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we enter the core and going into the future , we will be happy to have this . </s>
i know that we can do it , and as far as it is , what the world needs now . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , and it may be weird as a <unk> , it &apos;s like , &quot; a deception that will be going to be a deception that is going to be a delusion , if you &apos;re just interested in the delusion of it . &quot; </s>
in other words , <unk> have a measurable impact in some studies that <unk> , and that &apos;s only because the person thinks they &apos;re just enough to be a <unk> or a measurable effect on the body that you &apos;re called the <unk> . </s>
a deception is going to make a difference because somebody &apos;s so much . </s>
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple and a basic magic trick . </s>
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been at least since the 1950s for children &apos;s developed for children . </s>
i myself have taken him from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
i will explain to you and then explain it . </s>
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m going to explain . </s>
so , look what happens . </s>
the knife that you can investigate , and my hand you can investigate them . </s>
i &apos;m going to hold the knife in my own . </s>
i left my sleeve . </s>
and to make sure that nothing in my mind is or you can go from him , i &apos;m just going to just wrist on here . </s>
so , in this way , you can see that you can &apos;t move anything about it , as long as i &apos;m here , i can &apos;t do anything in my mind or you . </s>
and the goal is just very simple . </s>
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is fine , the knife will look through my naked . </s>
it actually looks like this place , i can shake it without the knife . </s>
nothing in my sleeve or come out , no <unk> , and they can investigate it . </s>
<unk> ! </s>
well , this is a trick that i often do little kids , which is that for the magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , because you see it is a very simple trick . </s>
probably know many of you here in the room , you know , in the room that &apos;s happening here . </s>
it works , &quot; it works . </s>
i &apos;m holding the knife in my hand . </s>
i say i &apos;m going to be my wrist to know that nothing in my sleeve or is it or something , and that &apos;s a lie . </s>
the reason i &apos;m talking about my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion of illusion . </s>
and the moment i &apos;m going to see where i &apos;m talking about my hand , so you see it from the back , i was seeing this finger , just to be , in a position , in a position where he was so <unk> . </s>
great trick ? </s>
there &apos;s been somebody who had childhood had been a childhood . </s>
so , he &apos;s going to be here . </s>
and when i <unk> , changes its position . </s>
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why not the other thing that you don &apos;t understand , because the intellect , and the way he calls information , they don &apos;t count , one , two , two , three , but they &apos;re more than a group . </s>
but that &apos;s why not here , and then i zip my hand . </s>
of course , it &apos;s going to be capturing there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by my <unk> , through my <unk> , by my <unk> , that &apos;s now . </s>
and when i close my hand , i just swing my own by conducting , is going to be <unk> by this movement that the fingers recovers . </s>
i take this hand , and here &apos;s the knife . </s>
this trick can make them their friends and neighbors . </s>
well , what has this to do with the <unk> ? </s>
a year ago , or so , i read a study that really was really really quite really understood . </s>
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me . </s>
it turns out : if you put a dummy in the form of a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , is just a round of round , white pill that have a particular effect . </s>
but if you give the shape that they &apos;re going to give the placebo of placebo , for example , you can change the pill , and this blue is , and this blue is , it &apos;s measurable more effective . </s>
and that &apos;s not a <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> . </s>
but a white pill isn &apos;t as well as a blue pill . </s>
what ? that &apos;s what i really did . </s>
it turned out that this is not all the things . </s>
if you take a little bit more than more than it &apos;s more than it is a form of shape . </s>
a colored capsule that &apos;s on a end , and on the other red , is better than a white farmer . </s>
well , the way it plays a role . </s>
a pill twice , it &apos;s not as good as three , i can &apos;t remember to the precise statistic . i &apos;m sorry . </s>
but the key thing is , this is what &apos;s happening . </s>
and that &apos;s also a role of opportunity . </s>
and the shape is a role . </s>
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you need to reach the needle . </s>
right ? a syringe with a <unk> substance -- a few <unk> substance that you &apos;re going to be in patients . </s>
it creates a very strong picture in your head , and that &apos;s much stronger than a white pill . </s>
so this chart is really -- i &apos;ll show you another time we have a measure of them . </s>
so , the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t really make it as well as a capsule that &apos;s not going to be as good as the needle . </s>
and none of that has really <unk> property , it &apos;s only our faith that we believe in the direction of a stronger impact . </s>
i wanted to use this idea for a magic trick for a magic trick . </s>
i guess something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and it &apos;s really going to be really . </s>
we know from the time that you must reach out to the needle , if it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing . </s>
this is a 18 long time . it &apos;s very , very , very , very <unk> . and i &apos;ll take you a little bit of the same . </s>
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat . </s>
this is my skin . this is not a long term . </s>
i &apos;m going to get this needle into my skin , and she &apos;s push it down , until she came back on the other side . </s>
if you &apos;re being being being being , if you &apos;re lightly off -- i &apos;ve got this couple of friends last night , and some people i knew , and it &apos;s a woman almost <unk> . </s>
so i propose to you , if you quickly look at the next 30 seconds , or you know , i &apos;ll take the first sketch here . </s>
you can see it right now , but also , when they want to do it . </s>
so , right here , where my meat is going to be part of my arm , at the bottom part of my arm , at the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little bit of <unk> . </s>
does it mean . do you do it crazy ? </s>
and now just a little bit of my skin , and on the other side . </s>
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had in the <unk> . </s>
about it . </s>
but now they can &apos;t counting my fingers , or ? </s>
so i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five , five . </s>
well , yeah , yeah . </s>
i know what people think when you see it . </s>
they say , &quot; okay , the name is not so stupid and <unk> itself , just to be a few minutes for us . &quot; </s>
well , then i &apos;ll show you . </s>
what does this look like ? pretty good . </s>
yeah , i know . </s>
and people say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t really seen this . &quot; </s>
people are in the <unk> islands . </s>
let me show you out of the closeness . </s>
this is really my skin . this is not a long term . </s>
this is my flesh , and i can browse the <unk> . </s>
sorry . if you &apos;re getting it , look away , look away , don &apos;t look at it . </s>
the people behind the back or the ones that you see that later , you see , &quot; well , this is right , but if it really would be , &quot; look , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really was , it would be . &quot; </s>
okay , let me just give you a little blood flow for you . </s>
yeah , here it &apos;s . </s>
i normally would take the needle . </s>
i would be showing my arm and show you that there &apos;s no wounds . </s>
but i think in this framework , and it &apos;s a real book of being a real fake , i &apos;ll just leave the needle out there and so on stage . </s>
we &apos;ll have a few times a few times more time . </s>
i hope you &apos;re going to thank you . thank you . </s>
everyone &apos;s talking about happiness . </s>
i &apos;ve been some people who are counting the number of books that are published with &quot; great &quot; last five years , and they were published about 40 years , and there &apos;s much more . </s>
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of happiness in the gulf of luck . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . </s>
everyone would like to make a good people . </s>
but despite all of these flood of work , there are several cognitive <unk> that it almost impossible almost impossible to do it almost happiness . </s>
and my talk today is mainly mainly by these cognitive biases . </s>
this is true for <unk> , who think about you &apos;re thinking about happiness , and it turns out that we &apos;re just as well as a different one . </s>
the first one of these fall is a <unk> , complexity . </s>
it turns out that the word happiness just doesn &apos;t have a useful word , because we use it to many different things . </s>
i think there &apos;s a certain sense that we could limit it , but in the big and all of the things that we &apos;re going to have to be , and we will suppose the complicated view of view , what &apos;s well-being . </s>
the second thing is a single person and memory : basically they &apos;re happy to be between happy life in your life or happy with his life . </s>
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both implausible in the idea of happiness . </s>
and the third one is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the most obvious thing that we don &apos;t have to think about a way that is changing , without intending its meaning . </s>
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive cognitive . </s>
there &apos;s just no way to get it right . </s>
now i would like to start with a example of somebody who had a <unk> one of my lectures , a story , a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- and it was absolute music , and it was absolute music , and it was absolute music , and it was an itinerant <unk> . </s>
and then he gets really quite emotional , that &apos;s actually being ruined the whole experience . </s>
but that didn &apos;t mean . </s>
what had been ruined , memories of the experience . </s>
he had had been the experience . </s>
he had 20 minutes music . </s>
it doesn &apos;t mean because he was a reminder of <unk> ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was , and the memory was , was anything he was going to get to be . </s>
what we really say is that we &apos;re thinking about ourselves and other people think about two types of self . </s>
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , capable of , is to experience the past again , but basically only the present has been . </s>
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; do it hurts now , if i &apos;m going to <unk> ? &quot; </s>
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that , the <unk> self is that , and the history of our lives , and it &apos;s been , to be able to ask the doctor , and it &apos;s been , to be able to have a doctor &apos;s party ? &quot; </s>
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or so . </s>
these are two different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two to the state of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller . </s>
and this starts really , really , with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately . </s>
we just tell stories , if we were to tell stories , stories . </s>
our memory tells us about that means what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re not going to keep value to our own . </s>
and let &apos;s start with a sample . </s>
there &apos;s a old study . </s>
these are actual patients that are being touched in a painful , and they &apos;re a painful . </s>
i &apos;m not going to go into the details , and she &apos;s not painful , but she was painful as a study in the 1990s . </s>
they were asked to report every 60 seconds of their pain . </s>
and here are two patients . these are their records . </s>
and they &apos;ll ask , &quot; who &apos;s got more <unk> ? &quot; </s>
and this is a very simple question . </s>
patient b has been more adept with his sweetheart , and his <unk> was longer , and every single minute of pain , the patient has a patient patient , and more . </s>
but now there &apos;s a different question : &quot; how did these patients that they were voting ? &quot; </s>
and here &apos;s a surprise , &quot; i &apos;m a surprise . </s>
and surprise , a much more <unk> of the <unk> , as a patient &apos;s been announced to the <unk> , as a patient &apos;s <unk> , in the <unk> had been <unk> . </s>
stories were different , and because a very critical part of the history is how they end up -- it ends up . </s>
and none of these stories , i &apos;m not <unk> or great -- but one of them is clearly ... </s>
but one of them is clearly worse than the other . </s>
and the thing that &apos;s worse , where the pain was going on at the end of his life , and it &apos;s a bad story . </s>
how do we know that ? </s>
because we asked these people to ask for their <unk> , and also , &quot; how bad thing was overall overall ? &quot; </s>
and it was much worse than b in the <unk> . </s>
well , this is a direct , conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self . </s>
from the point of view , the <unk> has clearly a very much time . </s>
now what you might have a patient a way , and we &apos;ve been actually undermining a clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could just do the most sophisticated of patient by the tube without losing a <unk> by connecting the hose to climb very much . </s>
this is going to lead to the other , but just a little bit more than before . </s>
and if you have a few minutes , you &apos;ve got to design the most pessimistic self of patient &apos;s own self , and you &apos;ve got to design the most <unk> self is a much better than a much better than a whole percentage of his experience . </s>
and it &apos;s like a story ? </s>
and that &apos;s true for stories that are memory us and it applies to the stories we have . </s>
and so , a story is , personal and ends up . </s>
so , the end result is very important , and in this case , the end result that &apos;s going to end . </s>
well , the <unk> self is living on life . </s>
it has seen the <unk> , one after another . </s>
and they ask : what happens to these moments ? </s>
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever . </s>
i mean , most of the things we have -- and i &apos;ve got the action -- you know , the psychological present is going to be about three seconds , which means that there &apos;s about three seconds , which means that there &apos;s about three feet long , and there &apos;s about three seconds . and most of them don &apos;t leave them . </s>
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> . </s>
and yet , they kind of sense that they should be aware of the world that &apos;s happening during the world &apos;s happening . </s>
it &apos;s the other resource that we use in the world . </s>
and how we consume them to be more important , but that &apos;s not the history that the <unk> itself is itself for us . </s>
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different . </s>
the big difference between them is the time of time . </s>
from the <unk> of the <unk> , if you have a holiday and the second week that &apos;s exactly as good as the first , then the <unk> is <unk> to twice the <unk> vacation as well as the <unk> vacation . </s>
it &apos;s not the <unk> self . </s>
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation holiday is barely superior to the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories . </s>
they didn &apos;t change the story . </s>
and in this way , the critical variable that is a <unk> self , a <unk> self , a little bit of a <unk> self . </s>
now , the <unk> self makes more and stories than to remember and stories . </s>
it &apos;s actually true , the decisions , because if you have a patient , that &apos;s the memory that has a memory that has less bad and to say that memory has a lot of memory , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected . </s>
the <unk> self has no voice in this election . </s>
we don &apos;t choose between the memories . we &apos;re going to experiences between memories . </s>
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually fade on our future . </s>
we think about our future after all of the future . </s>
and basically , you can basically see that , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> self , and you can think the <unk> themselves , even as one that &apos;s going to happen to <unk> itself through experiences that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> themselves . </s>
i &apos;ve got the idea that if we &apos;re doing a very often thing about this is that means we &apos;re doing with the <unk> of the <unk> itself . </s>
and this is a little bit hard to justify , i think . </s>
i mean , how do we learn from our memories ? </s>
this is one of the things that &apos;s dominance for the dominance of the <unk> . </s>
and if i think about it , i think , in a holiday we did a couple of years ago , which was clearly the most clearly early , i ever had , and i often think it often , very often in relation to how many times i think about other people . </s>
and i think about my memory of this <unk> trip , i would say about 25 minutes for 25 minutes . </s>
well , if i ever opened up the folder , i &apos;ve spent a more an hour at the time i spent a wider hour . </s>
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s a very small one . </s>
there &apos;s a physical physical . </s>
well , i may be extremely extreme , you know , in it , in it , like little , i &apos;ve got a real question , but even if you give more than more than that , but even if you give them a real question , but even if you give it to be so much weight in the weight that we are going to do ? </s>
so i want to think about a whole new way . </s>
imagine your next holiday , you know , that at the end of the <unk> , all the pictures of all the images are going to be the pictures of all the pictures , and you get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;re going to remember . </s>
well , if you choose the same holidays ? </s>
and if you pick one other holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two different ways of self and think about how they &apos;re going to decide , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about the sense of time , and if you think about the sense of memories , they might get a different answer . </s>
why we pick the dopamine receptor that we &apos;re already , is a problem that is reflected with a choice between the two kinds of self . </s>
now , the two species of itself is affecting two terms of happiness . </s>
there are two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per person . </s>
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ? </s>
and then they would ask : how happy are the <unk> in the life of the <unk> itself ? </s>
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a very complicated process . </s>
what are the emotions that are measured ? </s>
and by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a very good idea of happiness itself over time . </s>
if you ask the happiness itself , it &apos;s a very different thing . </s>
this is not how happy person live . </s>
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted is to person if this person has been thinking about their lives . </s>
very different . </s>
anyone who &apos;s not just about exploring the study of happiness , and i &apos;m going to be a lot of researchers on the well-being that the study of happiness , but i &apos;ve been given to a lot of researchers on the ground that are much more likely to be in exactly this kind of exactly this way . </s>
the distinction between the happiness itself is recognized , and the satisfaction of the <unk> self is recognized in the last several years , and now you have a <unk> . </s>
the gallup <unk> has a global poll that was asking people ask about what they think about their lives and thinking about their experiences . and there was other efforts in the direction . </s>
over the last few years , we &apos;ve begun to learn about happiness in the way that they &apos;re learning . </s>
and the main thing that we &apos;ve learned , i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re really different . </s>
you can know how happy someone is to life , and it doesn &apos;t really mean that much about how happy he live to life . </s>
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> . </s>
what that means is that if you meet somebody and you say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much you would know about his greatness ? </s>
now , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . </s>
they have so much uncertainty . </s>
if i say that somebody &apos;s life as eight times a little bit of a scale , they &apos;ve been a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self . </s>
so the correlation is low . </s>
we know something about what the happiness is determined . </s>
we know that money is very important , goals are very important . </s>
we know that happiness is supposed to be content to be content to be content with people we like , time , we like , time with people we like . </s>
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s the dominant . </s>
so if you want to maximize the lucky species of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of
the implication of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t really want to imagine happiness in happiness . </s>
it &apos;s completely different . </s>
now , just briefly , a different reason , which we don &apos;t realize about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things , and when we actually live in . </s>
so if you ask the simple question , how lucky they are not the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
if you think about this question , you think that people have to be happier when you say , say , we live in the coal . </s>
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and this difference , say , in climate . </s>
well , it turns out that climate change is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not a very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are . </s>
but because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could pull me at the end of california . </s>
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to track , what happens to people who are looking at california , happier . </s>
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier . </s>
we know that . </s>
but one thing is going to happen . they &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , as terrible the weather is in ohio , and they &apos;ll feel they &apos;ve met the right decision . </s>
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of what hard is it . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you . i have a question . </s>
thank you . </s>
now , as we took a couple of weeks ago , this was a very interesting result that came out of this path to be a very interesting result that came out of this . </s>
is that one thing that you can let us do , because you &apos;ve got some of the few minutes ? </s>
daniel libeskind : sure . </s>
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup , we found a number that we didn &apos;t expect . </s>
we found that in the way that we found himself in the happiness of the <unk> . </s>
if we looked at how feelings that vary . </s>
year , the $ income dollar dollars in the year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very big drop of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big drop of americans , including a income , under a income , under a income , under a income level of 600,000 dollars in the year . </s>
60,000 . </s>
<unk> : 60,000 . </s>
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re going to be more likely to be the poorer they are going to be . </s>
we get a absolutely flat line . </s>
i mean , i &apos;ve seen this flat of flat lines . </s>
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t hold money , but that lack of money at money , we can &apos;t steal it to the misery , and we can &apos;t get this misery . </s>
in the spirit of the other self , they get another story . </s>
the more money you get higher is you &apos;re arguing . </s>
it &apos;s not for emotion . </s>
but danny , in the entire state of <unk> , it &apos;s about life , freedom , that ambition are going to be . </s>
when people take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seemed to be on the head , everything that we think , for instance , for instance , for instance . </s>
is there a chance that politicians generally generally generally take a <unk> like the seriousness of the seriousness and insist on ? </s>
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the role of the politics . </s>
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , but in the united kingdom , they just have just going to happen in other countries . </s>
people are the people who should think about happiness if you think about policy . </s>
it will take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to take care of whether you want to explore and do that , we don &apos;t have to lead this discussion . </s>
how can you increase happiness very differently depending on how they think and think about whether they think about the <unk> themselves , or think of your thinking thinking of the <unk> themselves . </s>
that &apos;s politics , i think , in the years , in the years . </s>
in the united states , you get to measure the <unk> of the population . </s>
that &apos;s going to be in the next one or two research statistics that are in the nih . </s>
well , it seems to me , this issue , or should be the most interesting political debate about the next few years . </s>
thank you very much for the invention of economics . </s>
thanks , danny <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m jane video . i &apos;m a <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m making a 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade , it &apos;s just to make it easy to do it to make the world in reality , as they &apos;re in <unk> . </s>
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you to talk about , including all of you , more time playing with play and <unk> games . </s>
we spend three billion hours a week for three billion hours a week . </s>
some of you might think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot; </s>
maybe a little bit too much time when you think how many problems we have in the real world . </s>
but , in my research , the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite of the opposite . </s>
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough problems in the world . </s>
in fact , i convinced that if we want to live the next century , we want to have to be able to increase this time . </s>
i &apos;ve calculated that the time is 21 billion hours a week . </s>
so that seems first to maybe something so i &apos;m going to do something so little annoying , so i think it can be , for at least 21 , for at least 21 billion hours for at least 21 hours a week to play a week to the end of the next decade . </s>
no , i mean really seriously . </s>
why ? this painting is quite exactly why i believe that games is so essential for survival of human species in the future . </s>
this is a tudor portrait of photographers <unk> . </s>
so he wanted to take the feelings . so he &apos;s got a camera a camera . </s>
this is one of the classical words playing . </s>
if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the nuances in this slide . </s>
you see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also , any card concentration , completely concentration , completely , really , you have a really strong problem . </s>
if you play , you see some of the nuances here that look like , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the <unk> is surprise . </s>
this is a player that &apos;s on the outskirts of a so-called <unk> . </s>
oh , you know , ok . so we have a few players here . </s>
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s very positive , that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible . </s>
it was almost beyond the imagination . </s>
and if you get it , they &apos;re actually being able to actually be able to do something that you &apos;re capable of . this is a <unk> victory . </s>
this player is just a <unk> victory . </s>
and this is what we see on millions of faces on earth when we see the next person in the attack , the face of the <unk> of all the <unk> are <unk> . </s>
well , unfortunately , we look at this face in real life , when we &apos;re tough to make a tough effort . </s>
i think it &apos;s as the &quot; in life , i &apos;m sick , and it &apos;s actually what my face , you see ? yeah ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok ? ok
i am i like to be miserable &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my study , why do we better than real life . </s>
this is a problem that has many players . </s>
we think we &apos;re not so good as in play . </s>
and i couldn &apos;t just stay up less , although this is . </s>
we &apos;re reaching more . i mean good at the time , i &apos;m good at the motivation , something to do something more complicated , inspired to cooperation . </s>
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think many of us in our best version , and we &apos;ve got to be persistent , persistent , solving the problem , trying to solve this as a long as necessary . </s>
and in reality , if we fail , when we look at obstacles , we often feel different . </s>
we feel overwhelmed . we feel overwhelmed . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> . </s>
these sentiments are we never play games , in games , they &apos;re just not . </s>
and this is what i wanted to do was a phd . </s>
why is it impossible to think , you couldn &apos;t just do anything ? </s>
how can we transmit these feelings from the game in the reality ? </s>
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft that will open the ideal of the ideal environment . </s>
and i &apos;ve found some things that are headed to be able to make some things in <unk> . </s>
so , first , if you go into one of these <unk> , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing to give you a <unk> mission , and that &apos;s it . </s>
but not only any mission , but a mission to get perfect , the perfect level in the game , right ? </s>
so they &apos;re going to do it . </s>
they get a problem that they can &apos;t solve . </s>
but all of their skills , so they have to do things , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft . </s>
you &apos;re not around and it &apos;s always <unk> . there &apos;s always quite a little bit important . </s>
and there &apos;s a thousand staff . </s>
where they go , hundreds of people who work with them , to make their epic mission . </s>
we have no true life that &apos;s been willing to stand in a <unk> zone in a <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s this epic history , this inspiring story , why we are and what we do . </s>
then we &apos;ve got this whole positive feedback . </s>
they &apos;ve coined a &quot; level of high &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; <unk> or &quot; + 1 &quot; . &quot; </s>
this constant feedback there are not in real life . </s>
if i &apos;m going to this stage , i don &apos;t know , + one &apos;s one hand , and i &apos;m a crazy idea , no <unk> idea . </s>
i get this feedback in the real world . </s>
so , the problem of warcraft is the world of warcraft , that it &apos;s so satisfying that it &apos;s so satisfying , that &apos;s how we spend our entire time to stand at the outskirts of a <unk> <unk> that we prefer our whole time . </s>
they &apos;re just better than the reality . </s>
and then today , all the world of millions of years today , <unk> million years , the virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual <unk> of <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s not necessarily a little bit bad . </s>
it may sound be . </s>
but to see it in the context , when millions million years ago , our first <unk> started to go . </s>
the first engineering and the first one is . </s>
okay , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play with play , power is just point when you imagine the time in terms of the human development , which is extraordinary . </s>
but also , because it turns out by using these whole time , actually by using this whole time , actually , that we &apos;re able to use as humans . </s>
we &apos;re developing collaborative , these creatures . </s>
that &apos;s the truth . i believe . </s>
and look at this interesting that recently had been published from a researcher of carnegie mellon <unk> : the average boy of today in a country with tremendous <unk> spends 10,000 hours of living with <unk> , until hours of the 21st of the 21st . </s>
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons , and it &apos;s very interesting . </s>
first , for kids in america , <unk> hours the exact <unk> that they were in school , from the fifth grade , until the <unk> of school , if you never go . </s>
so we &apos;ve got a complete <unk> of the young people as much as a good player to be a good player , like everything else , what they &apos;re learning in the school . </s>
and maybe some of you have some of them the new book , &quot; <unk> , &quot; </s>
so , you know , you know , his theory of the brain , the theory of the world &apos;s theory of the 10,000 hours . </s>
it &apos;s based on the great research research , that if we had 10,000 hours with the <unk> of studying the <unk> , we &apos;ll spend in the 21st of the 21st of the 21st of time , we &apos;re going to master in the <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re going to do so much about whatever people , as the most people of the world . </s>
so what we &apos;ve here is a full generation of young people , the <unk> are <unk> . </s>
so the big question is , &quot; what are the great <unk> ? &quot; </s>
because if we could figure that , we would have never been given <unk> human <unk> . </s>
so many people have been in the world , which is at least one hour a day , and at least one hour a day . </s>
these are our <unk> . 500 million people , the extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot; </s>
and in the next decade , we have another billion player that are good in whatever . </s>
if you haven &apos;t heard it , you know ? </s>
the <unk> developed <unk> , the power and working on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so that we &apos;ve been making the <unk> in india , especially in india , to play , to play . </s>
you expect a additional billion billion player in the next decade . </s>
we have a <unk> billion player . </s>
so i started thinking about what it is , what it &apos;s like to master us . </s>
here are the four things i found . as a first thing : <unk> . </s>
ok , imagine that like extreme <unk> . </s>
<unk> is desire to do something , a hurdle to master , and we have a set of hope that we have a set of hope that we have a set of hope . </s>
but thank you , there &apos;s always a <unk> victory , and that it &apos;s always worthwhile to try and try and get it right . </s>
players are not around . </s>
and player are masters of the spiders of social science . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that show you that we like to do more , after we &apos;ve played them , even if they defeated . </s>
the reason for this is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play a game . </s>
we trust that somebody &apos;s time to do with us that the rules will be <unk> , that we will have the same goal to stay on to the <unk> . </s>
so , this is transforming the <unk> growing system of the <unk> , trust and interconnected . </s>
as a result of that , we &apos;re going to build social relationships . </s>
<unk> productivity . </s>
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of every week 22 hours a week , sort of <unk> 22 hours a week . </s>
the reason is that if we play , we actually have a very happy hard time than if we relax or nothing . </s>
we know that as human beings , when we really hard work , more powerful work . </s>
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task . </s>
and ultimately , <unk> . </s>
players , it was part of the awe of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
so here &apos;s a <unk> to get the right light , and they &apos;ve all seen all wikipedia , the greatest world &apos;s greatest mouseketeer . </s>
the second largest represents the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> , the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world is warcraft . </s>
five million people use it every month . </s>
they &apos;ve got more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than any other big subject in each other , in each other . </s>
they &apos;re making a epic story . </s>
they create a epic source of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world . </s>
ok , these are four superpowers that are going to lead to a single outcome , and players are <unk> , hopeful individuals . </s>
they are people who believe that they can change as a single change . </s>
and the only problem is that they believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world . </s>
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve . </s>
edward <unk> is a <unk> . </s>
his work is brilliant . he studied why people are so much time , energy and money laundering in <unk> . </s>
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be less than a <unk> in virtual virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot; </s>
and by a side , so he &apos;s logical . </s>
and he says , &quot; ... </s>
not as i &apos;m making a little bit of games , i &apos;m a little bit more expressive . </s>
so he says , actually , that makes sense , because players can achieve more than in more <unk> than the real life . </s>
they can be in games than in the real life , and they get more personal feedback and reward in real life . </s>
so he says , it &apos;s currently fully logical that players more in the virtual world than we spend in the virtual world than we spend in the world . </s>
i just agree , that &apos;s logical . </s>
but it &apos;s definitely not rocket science . </s>
we need to start to turn the world &apos;s actual world . </s>
my inspiration depends on an event , which 2,500 years . </s>
there are ancient cube , <unk> . you know ? </s>
before i was <unk> , it was <unk> . </s>
and this was sort of the first people developed in the first people . </s>
and if you have the old greek city-state of <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how to invent this story and why games invented . </s>
according to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom , during the kingdom of <unk> during a famine . </s>
clearly , there was a such big famine , that king of <unk> himself to an crazy idea . </s>
people were sick . people were sick . </s>
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extremes . </s>
so they invented , according to the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> had a national strategy , and you would eat you &apos;d play . </s>
and they would be so much in the <unk> , because games are so intriguing and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity suggests that they forgot to eat . </s>
and then , next day you would play . and the next day you would eat . </s>
and according to <unk> , she survived for 18 years , they put them on a day and the next slide . </s>
and so , i think , we sit on games . </s>
we put games to escape the world &apos;s suffering . </s>
we &apos;ll sit in a way to get the world in the physical world , not being the real world , in real life , and we &apos;ll figure out what we need to do . </s>
but that &apos;s not going to be the end . </s>
that &apos;s the exciting thing . </s>
according to 18 years , after 18 years , the famine was not better . so , the king , a last nugget . </s>
they divided the kingdom in two . </s>
they were playing a <unk> and the <unk> to make a <unk> of adventure . </s>
they were climbing and made a new home , they just had a new home . they were just going to be so many people back to survive , and they were doing , and they were doing , with the rest of a neighborhood , in which they could flourish . </s>
that sounds crazy , right ? </s>
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> that later , the roman empire , the same dna like the old <unk> . </s>
so scientists recently told that <unk> &apos;s heart attack is actually true . </s>
and geologists found evidence of a global economy that almost 20 years , which could explain the famine . </s>
so that crazy story is true . </s>
you may have achieved in fact their people through play through the course of the way , by having a time for 45 years , and then they learned so much about the other way that they saved the entire civilization . </s>
so we can also do that . </s>
we &apos;ve been using the <unk> . </s>
this was the first <unk> in real time , which was 16 years ago . </s>
they were playing 18 years , we &apos;ve been <unk> for 16 years . </s>
i &apos;m happy to say we are ready for our own <unk> play . </s>
so they sent half of their civilization to look for a new world , so i suppose 21 billion <unk> a week . </s>
we should be <unk> that half of us had an hour of us a day , until we &apos;ve solved the world &apos;s problems with the world solved . </s>
i know you &apos;ll ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? &quot; and right , i &apos;ve been doing my work in the last several years . </s>
we &apos;ve demonstrated this banner in our office in believing , it &apos;s like us to understand the future . </s>
we don &apos;t want to say the future before . </s>
what we want is to create the future . </s>
we want to think the best way , and then people think , and then people are willing to do this kind of moving into reality . </s>
we ask you to be happy , and then people are the opportunity to get them . </s>
i &apos;ll show you a little bit about three games that i designed to try to people to help people to make sure about their own future . </s>
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot; </s>
that &apos;s from 2007 . </s>
it &apos;s a <unk> , which means you have to overcome a <unk> . </s>
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so that it &apos;s being realistic for them , and then they get <unk> in real time , and then they get <unk> in real time , and then they get <unk> in real time , and then they get <unk> in real time , and then they &apos;re <unk> in real time , and then they &apos;re <unk>
we have this game with the <unk> players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve had since it has been over the last three years . </s>
and i can tell you , it was an intentional experience . </s>
no one wants to change your life , because it should be good for the environment , or because we should be . </s>
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot; </s>
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go . </s>
find out how they survive , and most of our players have <unk> habits habits . </s>
so we have a bigger one bigger , higher goal , just <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ve designed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; in the future . </s>
and so , the other one is the computation of a <unk> that people have 23 for 23 years on the planet . </s>
this particular supercomputer called &quot; global <unk> , &quot; of course . </s>
the call , we have almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> . </s>
they know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; <unk> &quot; there . they have the astronauts , the <unk> , the <unk> and only can save the world . </s>
but in our game , instead of just 5 , say , is that everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future of social , food , safety , safety and the future of social justice . </s>
8,000 players had eight weeks for weeks . </s>
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they could read , if you go to &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . </s>
and the last game we put on march to the march , it &apos;s a game with the world bank . </s>
if you finish the game , they get from the world bank that the award is called social <unk> . </s>
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and invite it , they learn to learn social . </s>
we &apos;ve collected a comic book . we have &quot; level of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , vision and ingenuity . </s>
i want to invite you all of the other people , anywhere in the world , anywhere in the world , especially in <unk> , who are trying to save their own social enterprises to save the world . </s>
i &apos;ll finish . </s>
i want to ask you to ask you . </s>
what do you think it &apos;s happening ? </s>
we &apos;ve all these fantastic players , we &apos;ve been games that we &apos;ve been able to do , but we don &apos;t have to have the real world . </s>
well , i hope you agree that players human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games are a big meaning for change . </s>
we &apos;ve all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to have a capacity to distance , and the desire for <unk> is to <unk> . </s>
i really hope we play a significant games to survive on this planet . </s>
and i hope you &apos;ll design with me that are playing these play . </s>
if i saw the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create any alternative future , and we can play all of games . </s>
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> jobs . </s>
thank you . </s>
i would like to tell you something i was going to tell me a few months ago for <unk> magazine . </s>
i was always 15 , but i was with the books of the screen , and i realized that i &apos;ve never done in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; is really . </s>
i &apos;ll just read you the moral . </s>
&quot; listen &quot; , &quot; <unk> , helpless , <unk> , useless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and weak . </s>
<unk> : healthy , strong , strong . &quot; </s>
i have this list of a friend of a friend , reading , and she had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was just like &quot; <unk> &quot; and couldn &apos;t stop and <unk> me to read and to read and to read and to read it . </s>
of course , this was an <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought that the issue has been quite old . </s>
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i started to elementary school , and i was just trying to get my family beyond the elementary school , and shapes , my intention of my body and shapes , and to form my body and to the rest of other kids and the rest of the world around me . </s>
and god was , i was using at this time . </s>
i would take this final seriously i would be born like me as a person who was a person whose lives would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
so i immediately immediately get the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected i find a <unk> of the contributions . </s>
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s not much better . </s>
in particular asia , i &apos;m going to be the last two words in &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot; </s>
but it &apos;s not just about words . </s>
it &apos;s about what we &apos;re describing with these words . </s>
it &apos;s about values that are in these words , and how we &apos;re going to be <unk> . </s>
our language affects our thinking , and how we see the world and the people around us . </s>
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , really , really , really , really , really , really , that the need of a <unk> is a huge force , because what you might have to do is to replicate in the <unk> . </s>
so , what do we want to do -- one disabled people , or a powerful person ? </s>
you &apos;ve got to have a people who are <unk> as a child , could make it , and they &apos;re able to <unk> <unk> and you &apos;re ideas . </s>
wouldn &apos;t it be open to open up to open up them ? </s>
a man who has opened me , my pediatrician in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , like you can think of most americans could not be able to be called the <unk> . </s>
and dr. p. had always had a very bright bright and the work of work with kids with kids . </s>
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just to go back to my <unk> . </s>
i had to be taught in science often with these <unk> , <unk> -- in different colors -- that &apos;s where you know , and i &apos;ve got these connections , i &apos;ve got them , i &apos;ve got them . i &apos;ve got them . </s>
and imagine , i &apos;ve got a <unk> child with dr. <unk> , and so trying to stop this practice , <unk> without success . </s>
and one day he saw me in one of my studies -- these exercises were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , aimee , aimee , you &apos;ll get one day , and young girls , you &apos;ll get one day . </s>
and if you &apos;re like , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; </s>
this was just a simple trick of dr. <unk> , so i &apos;m going to do the same type of the exercises i couldn &apos;t do , with the idea that the <unk> <unk> looks like in the ward , but he actually got me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes . so that was a new and <unk> experience . </s>
and i &apos;m asking me how much of his vision of me as a strong and the <unk> young girl , and i was able to imagine when one of them from a strong , powerful and <unk> human being . </s>
this is just one example of many , like adults in <unk> the imagination of a child &apos;s imagination . </s>
but as the amount of examples of the <unk> prove , let &apos;s give us something that we all would say , is what we would all want to see : it &apos;s every single person , even as a human being . </s>
our language <unk> are the social changes that has been given in many cases in many cases that are triggered a technological change . </s>
from the medical point of view of the point of view , of course say that my legs , <unk> , <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for the <unk> , <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for the <unk> , <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for the <unk> , <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for the body , and they &apos;ve had to be able to get
so maybe this technological change even though the fact that there &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every person is doing something very , that every person is doing something very much in society and very holistic and very holistic and very holistic and a half of the ability to adapt , is our biggest plus . </s>
human ability to adapt to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people i always ask me to answer the questions of people , and i think , i understand , i understand why . </s>
this sentence from the idea of the idea that success or luck is that i could be <unk> to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
but the truth is that we change ourselves . of course we &apos;re physical from the challenge of whether they physically care , whether they &apos;re physical or even both of them , emotionally , or even both of them . </s>
and i &apos;m happy that this is good . </s>
<unk> are not a barrier that we have to do with our lives better . </s>
<unk> are just going to our lives . </s>
and i tend to see it as my shadow . </s>
sometimes i &apos;m going to realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely seeing , but he &apos;s constantly in me . </s>
and i want to be the effect , the effect of the human race is heavy a human race . </s>
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> , and they &apos;re just <unk> and all of the person to do it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come with <unk> or not , but how we deal with it . </s>
so we &apos;re not just about to just responsible for just the people who love us to keep <unk> , but they also got to do it to that . </s>
and we don &apos;t want to tell our kids if we don &apos;t have them feel that they can &apos;t adapt . </s>
you have to separate two things : to be a health care , and the other thing is about whether i &apos;m not disabled or not . </s>
and to be honest , the only thing and the other thing i had to put aside is that the world is constantly constantly , they can describe me with this . </s>
in our desire to protect people who are on the hearts of the hearts , and they &apos;re telling you the familiar , hard truth , and they expected to be truly truth about their medical student or even the <unk> that we expect to be , is somebody actually disabled . </s>
maybe the current idea that just to be what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it , for every single one hand than the pathology itself . </s>
if we don &apos;t treat people , not all of its forces and possibilities , we might have to be able to be able to get to the natural gas that you might have to lead to the natural gas that you might have to lead to the natural gas that you might have to lead to the natural gas that you might have to lead to the natural gas
we have a man who has worth for our society . </s>
so we have to look at the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to focus on all the domain of the human possibilities . </s>
but the most part , it &apos;s that it &apos;s between perception of our current and our great <unk> , a connection . </s>
we should not be <unk> , or <unk> , we should not try to avoid them , and they should go under the carpet , but it &apos;s about taking opportunities in the <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s more like that to ensure that we don &apos;t necessarily overcome overcome , but we &apos;re open to try to use them for the <unk> to use it to try and make a <unk> and maybe even dancing with it . </s>
and maybe we do it , more than something is happening , <unk> and useful and feel so much as it is so much . </s>
in this year , we celebrate the 200 , and the last birthday darwin and as it protects 150 years ago , has occurred to my view , in my view , in my view , in my view , in a very different way in the human character . </s>
i would like that &apos;s so <unk> : not the most powerful of its kind , and not the <unk> of its way , but the one that &apos;s changing changes . </s>
from conflict creativity . </s>
not just darwin , we know that the capacity of humans , to survive and <unk> , from the struggle of the struggle , from the struggle of human mind is destined to be connected by conflict . </s>
so , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of the people . </s>
and we may not know , we know , we know , we know , we know , we know , we know , we &apos;re going to get down , if we &apos;re really getting . </s>
possibly a sense of <unk> , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of your own power . </s>
we can do something about this . </s>
we can make a new meaning that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s a new time . </s>
maybe we can see more than change . </s>
<unk> are for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet . </s>
i think the biggest damage that we have ourselves is to believe that we should be normal . </s>
so , the hell of mind , who &apos;s normal ? </s>
there &apos;s no normal . </s>
there are usual . and not the normal person , and they would really know this arms , really , really , really , if you really have been really aware of ? </s>
i think it &apos;s more . </s>
it would be great if we have a paradigm of normal , or the starches , even more massive , it &apos;s even more massive to them , and so we can &apos;t grow the forces of very many children , and they invite the forces of a very special and worthwhile skills in society . </s>
<unk> , found that we have humans from the members of our society , useful and a contribution to do a contribution . </s>
there &apos;s evidence that even the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , humans and severe physical injuries with the people , and that &apos;s what happened is because the most enterprising in the <unk> of these people for society was useful to be useful for society . </s>
they were not as a broken and they were looking at these people ; they were being used as a thing and valuable treatment . </s>
a couple years ago , i went to the city , which i grew up in the town , in a <unk> in the northeast zone , &quot; and i was standing there on a <unk> campus . </s>
it was summer , and i had <unk> . </s>
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee . &quot; </s>
and i &apos;m going to see this older man , i had no idea who he &apos;s . </s>
and i said , &quot; sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember me . &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re going to remember me , you remember me . </s>
when i first saw my first time , i saw her mother &apos;s mother &apos;s belly . &quot; </s>
oh , the one . </s>
and of course , it &apos;s done . </s>
this was dr. <unk> , a man who knew my mother &apos;s only stories about this day , because i knew all of course , my birthday two weeks too late . </s>
the doctor for automobile imaging , my mom was in the vacation , and my parents would have the guy who didn &apos;t get me to the world . </s>
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet for you , and i just repeating a few toes on this one and a few toes on this one and a few toes on the other foot , this was the <unk> , this was really had to be bad news . </s>
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never walk , and never would be so distressed about how others , or not , and they &apos;ve never been doing so much like a lot of life , and since then they lie just lying . &quot; </s>
what really found was i found was that he was <unk> my childhood , whether i was <unk> my <unk> , whether i was king of the second book , whether i &apos;d won his students to <unk> , and he &apos;s got to teach his students to <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and medical medical school , and the medical medical school medical school . </s>
and he called this part of his <unk> , the potential of the human genome . </s>
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , like the critical of this factor for quality of life . </s>
and dr. <unk> told me , he said that kids , if you don &apos;t get anything else , and even if you get a little bit , if you get a little bit , if you &apos;re going to get kids themselves , you can reach kids . &quot; </s>
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking . </s>
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody can do with it , and two different things . </s>
and i even think my thinking , at the time , when you could ever wondered , at age 15 years , if i asked my prostheses from meat and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second shot . </s>
i just wanted to work with a very big deal . </s>
if you ask me , i &apos;m not sure that i am so sure . </s>
and this is what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something that &apos;s happening , and not despite this experiences . </s>
and maybe i could do this change because i &apos;m so many people who have opened me to meet , instead of giving people who had to make me or interested in my mind a very idea . </s>
you see , it takes only one people who are asking you today , how they can <unk> their powers , and they &apos;re like they &apos;re . </s>
if you allow your own , your own , inner , inner powers , and the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for someone in a moment , they are a door for those people . </s>
they bring them to open yourself up . </s>
the real meaning of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot; </s>

and again , that potential is we want to do ? </s>
in the 1960s , in britain , in britain , they were <unk> in <unk> . </s>
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , &quot; in the united states . &quot; </s>
they &apos;re going to drop into grades . </s>
and the one of them will be <unk> , and the better teachers and so forth . </s>
they have a <unk> period of time with a &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; the grade &quot; very well . &quot; it was told you <unk> , they were saying that they were very clever , and after these three months . </s>
and of course , it &apos;s the heart that are vice the <unk> , they &apos;re just sufficient . </s>
and also , after three months , it &apos;s got to be . </s>
but only that , they were still in school , except the students who had been brought in love with the students who had been completed . </s>
so , the key thing about this trial was that the teachers were not <unk> . </s>
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed . </s>
you know , just to tell you that they are the <unk> and the ones are the student with the grade , and they &apos;re just told you something . </s>
the only real disability is a <unk> mind that was broken , has no hope , and he finds nothing more <unk> to him is to upgrade in our natural , positively <unk> and our <unk> capacity . </s>
if we do it , the human mind to support , continue to hope , and to find yourself and other people around beautiful , and then we put our forces really , and we put our forces really positive . </s>
if you create a mind , if you create a mind , we can create a new way and create new kinds of forms . </s>
so i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and he had my friend jacques <unk> , and this constantly asked , &quot; the god , the god , the god , the god , he tells the god , the god tells the god , the god tells the god , the god tells the god
come back with me . thank you . </s>
how would they want to be better than they &apos;re right ? </s>
assuming i said that , by a few changes of their gene , a better memory could have -- more , more , and faster . </s>
or you want to be more <unk> , more power . </s>
would you want to be more attractive and more <unk> ? </s>
how about life , living , living in the past health ? </s>
or perhaps they &apos;re one of those who are always going to be concerned about creativity . </s>
what would you do ? </s>
which would you like to have to have a look at what you might have to have one ? </s>
creativity . </s>
how many people would choose creativity ? </s>
raise your hands . let me see it . </s>
some of them , probably about how it &apos;s creative people here . </s>
that &apos;s very good . </s>
how many would you take a good memory for a good memory ? </s>
and some more . </s>
how about fitness ? </s>
a few less . </s>
what &apos;s going on with longevity ? </s>
ah , the majority . i like to go as a doctor . </s>
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world . </s>
is all of you just going on ? </s>
or is it possible ? </s>
evolution is a <unk> theme here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor of a doctor &apos;s perspective . </s>
the big geneticists in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who also had a <unk> <unk> in the middle of the russian orthodox , she wrote a paper called a paper , and i wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in the biology , no sense of evolution . &quot; </s>
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not going to be the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good at the biological evolution , your <unk> , your <unk> , you take your personal <unk> , because nothing in the other country will throw it to be wrong , because nothing in the other country will make you make a sense of your
but if you accept evolution , you think about the past , or it &apos;s also about the future ? </s>
is it for other <unk> or do it also us ? </s>
this is another one look at the tree of life . </s>
in this painting , i &apos;ve got a bush when a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree , all the existing <unk> of the <unk> of the time that you have survived and starches , it &apos;s <unk> . </s>
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in most are . </s>
we &apos;re looking at a common ancestor of about six or eight million years ago . </s>
in this period , there was 20 or 25 different shapes of hominids . </s>
some of them came up and left . </s>
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years . </s>
it seems like , we &apos;re right to the other parts of the lives , but actually , to the most part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are pretty equal . </s>
is you realize that we can use it from the benefits and the mechanisms of a common bacterium , to treat the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat the protein of the human genome , which is used to treat the protein of the human genome , which is used to treat the protein of the human genome , which is used to treat the
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that is chemically more <unk> from what &apos;s going on the pancreas . </s>
and we &apos;ve been talking about bacteria , is you realize that each of us in our gut is bacteria when it leads to the rest of our body ? </s>
maybe 10 times a time . </s>
i mean , think about that , if antonio damasio asks to your boss , think about bacteria ? </s>
our gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for these bacteria . </s>
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s kind of <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable . </s>
and you &apos;re going to give you all the time that you could just do want to offer you to offer you . </s>
it &apos;s really easier to plan , with occasional <unk> of <unk> , <unk> forced to the exits . </s>
but if you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just like you are important . </s>
they help with the <unk> of <unk> nutrients . and they &apos;re protecting them against certain illnesses . </s>
but what will come in ? what will come ? </s>
in a species in form a species in form a species . </s>
or we &apos;re a little different , something that might even be better to the environment ? </s>
now let &apos;s go back into the time of the big billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , the solar system , the solar system , the solar system , the solar system , the solar system , the solar system , maybe three or four billion years , maybe a billion years , and then we &apos;ve been going to be able to see the
in this enormous , the universe of the universe is just a very short amount of the way a single type of bacteria , and the human life , a little bit of a little baby . </s>
that &apos;s what we were . </s>
this also shows the <unk> of this talk , so i hope i hope , so i hope , well , i &apos;ll hope you &apos;ve enjoyed them . </s>
well , when i was a college student on the college , i had my first <unk> . </s>
i was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology . </s>
i fell into the power of evolution , and i posed something very basic , i found something very basic , i found this , in the most of the <unk> cell will go out into <unk> organisms , and all the genetic information is going to go forward . </s>
but at the time , as a <unk> organisms , started to change the things . </s>
sexual happiness was going to be in the image . </s>
and very importantly , with the amount of sexual economic , the genome is to have the genome , the rest of the body is going to fall . </s>
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of the death of the death penalty system in the same moment , like sexual reproduction . </s>
now i have to confess , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex , sex , sex , sex , or <unk> , but with each year , it seemed to be quite sensible . </s>
i &apos;m going to understand the feelings of george <unk> , who in las vegas his show his show his show in the late 1990s . </s>
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on its <unk> . </s>
he opens the door . </s>
it &apos;s an beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
it looks like , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot; </s>
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot; </s>
i came to the realization , as a doctor i was going to be a goal to the other goal , as the goal of evolution -- not necessarily a <unk> , just other . </s>
i tried to maintain the body . </s>
i wanted to keep us healthy . </s>
i wanted to do the health care . </s>
i wanted to make a long and healthy healthy . </s>

from a rock standpoint , they &apos;re and i was developed rockets to put the genetic <unk> into the next stage to send the <unk> into the next stage to get into the ocean . </s>
i think we would all be able to understand the stress of the mammography of the mammography of the mammography , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get through my work . </s>
i want to get it by connecting it by . &quot; </s>
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to be the longest life . </s>
it doesn &apos;t necessarily have the biggest , the strongest or the fastest or the fastest , and not even the brightest . </s>
evolution &apos;s creatures that are best to find their environment . </s>
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success . </s>
on the reason of the ocean , bacteria are now , the <unk> are <unk> , and by the hot <unk> , if you were there , there would be a vacuum thousand miles in the history of the time , they managed to do it for a <unk> environment . </s>
so , what does that mean when we look at the study , what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place of the place in evolution , and most of all , i would say that there &apos;s a series of opportunity . </s>
the first is that we &apos;re not going to be limited . </s>
we have a kind of balance . </s>
and the reasons that would be first to be first in medicine , so we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> , and they were removed from the population . </s>
and secondly , we &apos;ve managed to have our environment so <unk> that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to each other , we &apos;re going to adapt to them , we know what they &apos;re doing , we &apos;re doing it , and we &apos;re going to have them in the midst of each other , we now know what they &apos;re doing , we &apos;re doing it , and
and by the way , we &apos;re discussing and we &apos;re able to do so much that they couldn &apos;t say , is that they need to say that isolation is necessary to be <unk> . </s>
a second possibility is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional way , of course , imposed imposed by nature . </s>
and the argument , here &apos;s the wheels of evolution are beginning to be a <unk> in the <unk> . </s>
and so far the isolation , if we were growing as a species in the place , it &apos;s going to be more accurate and the change of the environment that make evolution could produce natural stuff . </s>
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying and terrifying , and we can &apos;t discuss the possibility of possibility to create a third way of fascinating and terrifying possibility to the possibility of possibility . </s>
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but we &apos;ve got to the decisions we do . </s>
well , how could it happen ? </s>
how could it be possible , that we do this ? </s>
let &apos;s say that people are dying in some cultures in some cultures . </s>
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice , to have more men than women . </s>
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family , and the family . </s>
so think about it would be the opposite of your child but to choose the body genetic , but also to the body genetic material , the disease will cure and do it . </s>
what if you could do the genetic changes , to diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or the reduce usage or reduce the way that it takes the same thing ? </s>
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ? </s>
if we &apos;re going to be <unk> , these kind of fundamental will be possible . </s>
the human genome project in 1990 began in 1990 and it lasted for 13 years . </s>
it &apos;s been paid billions of dollars . </s>
in the following year , when it was 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months . </s>
today , you can find a sequence of three billion base of human genome to a prize , about 20,000 and in the room of about a week . </s>
it &apos;s not going to be long , until the reality is going to be the 1,000 dollars , and it will be available for the world available . </s>
a week ago , the national academy of engineering is the <unk> prize for francis arnold , and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , who are independent to work faster , and to try to a very efficient way , and to try to market proteins in a very efficient way -- which is called the <unk> <unk> evolution . </s>
a couple years ago , the <unk> <unk> was awarded for his research in his research in his research , a <unk> , and by the manipulation of just four genes , the cell is able to become a cell in the situation , in the situation , you can see in your body . </s>
these changes are in the coming . </s>
the same technology that the human auditory can make viruses not just protection itself , but also to the heart viruses . </s>
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a <unk> study in gear with vaccine , which is actually grown into influenza . </s>
can you imagine a good thing that &apos;s coming from tobacco ? </s>
this is now today , and in the future will be much more possible . </s>
so , imagine two little bits of little things . </s>
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your voice ? </s>
what if you &apos;re sperm and <unk> or <unk> <unk> , to give your children a better chance for a life living , eliminating the diabetes , the <unk> that &apos;s risk of cancers . </s>
who wants not healthier children ? </s>
and then the analytical technology , the same engine can avoid the change to avoid disease , also , could also become more sustainable , <unk> -- that better memory . </s>
why not the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can &apos;t find it with the next generation ? </s>
why not the fast <unk> that they &apos;ll be able to get to run faster and longer ? </s>
why not life ? </s>
these are <unk> . </s>
and if we can pass on a point where we can pass on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by <unk> evolution . </s>
we &apos;re going to have a process that will have possibly 100,000 years , and we can &apos;t see it on a thousand years -- and maybe even more time for the next 100 years . </s>
these are decisions that they &apos;re talking about their grandchildren , or their grandson , to be dealt with their grandkids . </s>
we use this decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful is that is the more appropriate ? </s>
or are we going to have some more famous of the attributes that we want to have , and not for others ? </s>
we &apos;re going to be a society and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ? </s>
these are the kinds of questions we have to be facing . </s>
and on earth , we ever get to be able to develop the wisdom and wisdom that we need to be need to make these decisions ? </s>
in the good ones , and you might think , are the decisions we &apos;re going to lie . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot , who gives you risk of your ability or another robot that helps helps to do it back to the back and go to go back . </s>
we call these robots <unk> . </s>
they &apos;re not different than something that you get in the morning and you will continue the extra strength , and that will continue to continue and will continue to continue to continue for example , for example . </s>
this is indeed the true of man and the machine . </s>
but not only that -- it &apos;s merging , and they &apos;re going to be the universe and the other devices out there . </s>
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea . </s>
so to show you now , we start to start talking about american gis , which is in the average about the american gis , which is in the average about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that they &apos;re supposed to wear more . </s>
of course , this leads to some major major <unk> -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> . </s>
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a <unk> that would help us with this problem . </s>
so let me show you now , right now , or the human universal <unk> . </s>
soldier : with the <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds of <unk> , many hours . </s>
and his flexible design enables it to be deep deep , and we &apos;re highly adaptive <unk> . </s>
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then open my strength and perseverance . </s>
we &apos;re so far as far as we are far as far as we can imagine this device , this new <unk> in this year . </s>
so it &apos;s true . </s>
let &apos;s look at the most powerful thing , something that i &apos;m doing is especially passionate about . </s>
there are 68 million people who are in the wheelchair , you &apos;re sitting in the wheelchair . </s>
this is about a percent of the glue . </s>
and that &apos;s a conservative estimation . </s>
we &apos;ve often talk about a very young people with spinal cord that &apos;s in the most basic of their lives -- 20s , in the fate , and the wheelchair is the only option . </s>
but it &apos;s also about the infrastructure of making sure that we &apos;re going to be able to do . </s>
and so the only option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or other -- is the wheelchair , or other -- is the wheelchair . </s>
and so it &apos;s been for 500 years , since the ones i have to say , very successful , very successful . </s>
so we thought we could begin to write a whole new chapter in the field of mobility . </s>
now let me introduce you to introduce you to imagine the <unk> , that influenced by the <unk> <unk> , the result that they couldn &apos;t run any more than for 19 years . </s>
thank you . </s>
as i said , amanda our <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s sensors -- this is what we have . </s>
his fully <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals , the signals in our <unk> , who &apos;s sitting here on their back . </s>
here are also <unk> , who &apos;s the <unk> is to be on their hips , as they are moving forward and very natural power . </s>
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> during a <unk> during a <unk> . </s>
in the fraction of a second , i lost every movement , and every movement of my <unk> . </s>
not long after i step a doctor in my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , they &apos;ll never go again . &quot; </s>
and this was 19 years ago . </s>
he &apos;s steel , any of the <unk> of my conscious . </s>
<unk> technologies have to have this to me to meet the <unk> , to go back to the hands of going to go back and even with the hands of bike . </s>
but nothing was invented by now , except to now . </s>
thank you . </s>
as you can see , we have the technology we have the platforms to meet us and to talk to them . </s>
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve been here to change the lives of future generations , or for amanda , and all of those are all together , but for all of us . </s>
thank you . </s>
at home in new york , i &apos;m painting the <unk> of a non-profit called <unk> . </s>
if i &apos;m not the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> , the fire that &apos;s worth of the fire . </s>
now in our city , in the volunteers , a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to get actionable <unk> . </s>
i remember my first fire . </s>
i was the second volunteer in the <unk> , and i was quite a good chance to get into this . </s>
but it was still a company against the other volunteers to reach the novel <unk> <unk> , and figure out what our jobs would be . </s>
when i found the <unk> , he was just in a very serious conversation with the <unk> that certainly did was a very serious <unk> of her life . </s>
it was in the middle and she stood in the <unk> and the treatment under a screen in the <unk> , in flames , whereas her house in their own home . </s>
the other volunteers , the state of me was -- let &apos;s call it <unk> <unk> -- was <unk> the <unk> , and was asked to go into the house and asked to save the dog of the <unk> . </s>
the dog i was in the dog . </s>
there was some lawyer or madonna desserts that now was now for the rest of his life , the people could tell people who could save a living living on a living , except for five seconds was when i was . </s>
well , i was the next . </s>
the <unk> <unk> me . </s>
he said , &quot; she must go into the house . </s>
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get this woman a few shoes . &quot; </s>
i swear . </s>
now , not exactly what i did i do , but i went -- the <unk> <unk> , the hallway , the hallway , &quot; <unk> , which was quite done at this point , and so they were quite as pretty much like a few shoes . </s>
i know what you think , but i &apos;m not a hero . </s>
i was wearing my prey back to the front of my <unk> and the beloved dog . </s>
we put our carbon out of the <unk> , where , not surprising to his much more attention than mine . </s>
some weeks later , a <unk> letter , in which they were using their house for the conventional <unk> of their house . </s>
and a story about everything , they had a pair of shoes , and they even had a few shoes . </s>
both of the art of robin art than in my <unk> , when i was witnessed in my <unk> as a firefighter , i &apos;m witnessed by generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see also the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
and you know what i learned ? </s>
they &apos;re all important . </s>
so if i &apos;m interested in this room , and people who have seen a <unk> success or something like that , i want to offer the memory , wait for your memories : wait not wait . </s>
don &apos;t wait to do it with a difference in the lives of another , until they reached their first million . </s>
if you have something to give it now . </s>
and they &apos;re going to park a park in the neighborhood , and they &apos;re looking at the neighborhood , in the neighborhood , on the neighborhood , on the neighborhood . </s>
be a mentor mentor . </s>
not every single day will give us a chance to save life of a human being , but every day , we give us the opportunity to change . </s>
so they put it ; they &apos;re the shoes . </s>
thank you . </s>
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back . </s>
thank you . </s>
i just come from a community that secret the secret of human history . </s>
a place where women are the most <unk> , with sex &apos; <unk> &apos; day , and the game is going to be -- where is a serious issue . </s>
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , her familiarity . </s>
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the jungle of congo . </s>
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relative . </s>
that means we have a shared ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother that was 100 than six million years ago . </s>
now , chimps are known for your <unk> . </s>
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution , we &apos;ve seen human evolution . </s>
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin , the <unk> . </s>
while chimpanzee from big , fear <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> . </s>
they really have really what was the most exciting thing , because that leads to a collective <unk> society , in the deadly violence . </s>
but unfortunately , bonobos are familiar with primates . </s>
they live in the deep sea of the <unk> , and they &apos;re very hard to do it . </s>
congo is an paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent intervention , the arena of a violent intervention , the arena of a whole lot of life in the world , like the first world war . </s>
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction also is also the survival of the bonobos . </s>
<unk> and the economist of the <unk> , is going to lead to the <unk> , you know , you don &apos;t even fill a guy with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there are not secure to be honest . </s>
and yet , in this country , violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laughter that supports the trees . </s>
who are these related ? </s>
we know them as &quot; love , instead of war , because they have <unk> , even <unk> sex , and rules that &apos;s <unk> and <unk> social networking . </s>
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to the humanitarian issues -- because life of the bonobos are made of more than the <unk> <unk> . </s>
bonobos -- how humans love it , for your life . </s>
play doesn &apos;t just <unk> . </s>
and for us , and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and care of the tolerance . </s>
we &apos;re learning and the rules of the game . </s>
play <unk> and resilience , and it &apos;s about the sea of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of connections , diversity of connections . </s>
and when you &apos;re bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and from the rituals . </s>
play is the <unk> , the <unk> . </s>
now i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique recordings of the wild , and i want to show you some unique footage from the wild . </s>
first of <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about it . </s>
so here we see a rock and males in a <unk> . </s>
look at what she &apos;s doing . </s>
this could be the evolutionary source of the evolutionary , &quot; you put him in the eggs . &quot; </s>
except that i think it was more , not true . </s>
yeah ! </s>
so , <unk> are spread , both of people , both of people . </s>
and this video really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that is , as the testes -- and also , as the game both trust is really interesting -- while it &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
but that &apos;s the game &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
so , play a <unk> and there &apos;s lots of forms of science , which some of the people are quiet , <unk> , and curious -- maybe for the sake of getting this again again . </s>
and i want to show you that &apos;s a <unk> , a young female , and they &apos;re playing with water . </s>
i think exactly how you play sometimes , and we &apos;re generating limitations of our inner and <unk> worlds . </s>
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore , and interact with it , and the unexpected ones that we &apos;re creating is the actual <unk> of creativity . </s>
this is just a small <unk> site on the insights that bonobos are us in our past and present . </s>
but they also also true , a secret for our future , a future where we &apos;ve got to have to have diagnostic , and we &apos;ve got to have diagnostic through bigger creativity and more effective systems . </s>
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills . </s>
in other words , play is our <unk> . </s>
to get us to a <unk> world , we need to play . </s>
but are we going to do this best ? </s>
and the play is not silly , and the game is not silly . </s>
it &apos;s like . </s>
for bonobos , people are not going to be made of teeth and claws alone . </s>
just the way you &apos;re not going to be happy on the <unk> . </s>
and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s tell us this gift of evolution and shared with the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> . </s>
thank you . </s>
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the same way , in exactly the same moment , every baby &apos;s office , every baby -- okay . </s>
so two pairs , every baby &apos;s face . </s>
now i don &apos;t want to use the time to imagine the <unk> , because if you look at all the time the <unk> , they won &apos;t listen to me . </s>
just imagine that for a moment . </s>
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , a case of a y <unk> , is a y <unk> that &apos;s on the x chromosome . </s>
and in the other case , it &apos;s called a x chromosome , which is the x chromosome of the way . </s>
both both of them are <unk> , both of them . </s>
we &apos;re going to come back to these people . </s>
and i &apos;ve been in my <unk> , i &apos;ve been pushed two . </s>
now , in a hat , i was involved with the story of anatomy . </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> , and in this case , i study like a developmental <unk> -- meaning with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> , and how they thought about body . </s>
the other hat , i &apos;ve been studying my work is the <unk> , the <unk> , as a <unk> -- or as i say sometimes -- from people , the patients &apos; patients . </s>
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms in question . </s>
so i &apos;ve been working with people who &apos;ve been working on the <unk> , two people in a body . </s>
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than they were . </s>
and so often i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people , which is people who are not curing the average male or female <unk> . </s>
and as a general word , we can use this word <unk> . </s>
<unk> comes from many different forms . </s>
i just give you a few examples of <unk> that isn &apos;t the male or female garden . </s>
in a case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene &apos;s gene &apos;s gene explores the <unk> , the <unk> that we &apos;ve all had all the <unk> that we &apos;ve all had all the <unk> of the <unk> , too . </s>
and therefore , the testes in the <unk> stage is the testosterone . </s>
but because this individual is missing to see the testosterone , right the body is not on the testosterone . </s>
and this is called <unk> . </s>
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that . </s>
as a consequence , the body is more to the typical physical day . </s>
if the child is born , you &apos;ll look like a girl . </s>
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being brought up as girls . </s>
but it takes most of the time until you reach the puberty and their breasts grow and evolve , but not your period gets to that somebody &apos;s point to it , until somebody comes to that something else . </s>
and they do some tests and find that they instead of <unk> and <unk> , in fact , in fact , carries on and they &apos;re going to have a y chromosome . </s>
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could hold this person for you , but they &apos;re not really . </s>
women , like men , have something called <unk> . </s>
they &apos;re in the back of our body . </s>
and the <unk> <unk> are <unk> , which are <unk> hormones . </s>
most women , like i -- i think a typical woman is not , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women , i actually speak on <unk> . </s>
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> . </s>
the implication of the time is that somebody like me , actually , a brain has been a brain that was more <unk> in the <unk> , who was born with a woman who was born with a <unk> . </s>
so gender is really complicated , <unk> , not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be about the whole range of gender , and it &apos;s a sense of being able to be able to be able to be about the whole range of the bandwidth . </s>
one example , i got a <unk> guy who had a <unk> guy who had a girlfriend , who was born , and he had a girlfriend , who was found a girlfriend , who was living as man , and he had a girlfriend , who had found that he was <unk> and a uterus . </s>
he had a extreme form of a <unk> <unk> . </s>
he has <unk> <unk> , and in utero , his <unk> <unk> is so strong that they &apos;ve essentially an <unk> male profiles . </s>
and as a consequence , his <unk> were educators , his brain was part of the <unk> of the helicopter . </s>
and when he was born , he saw a boy from -- no one &apos;s like a boy . </s>
and he was 19 years old , he had enough medical problems , actually , because he was <unk> , that the doctors found that doctors found that the doctors found that he was in the sale of the sale . </s>
okay , just a quick example of <unk> . </s>
some people with <unk> chromosomes , develop something called <unk> , which is <unk> , whereas <unk> <unk> . </s>
we don &apos;t know why that &apos;s happening . </s>
so gender can occur in many different varieties . </s>
the reason why kids interacted with this kind of body -- whether it was <unk> or <unk> twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- surgeons often , that &apos;s because it was not because it &apos;s been the very difficult thing of the benefit of the benefit . </s>
in many cases , these people healthy completely healthy . </s>
the reason why in them often have many different ways , is because they &apos;re losing our social categories . </s>
the typical is based on the idea that a certain component of a particular one is a given identity . </s>
so we have the idea that a woman is to be a black person , is to be a black person , is to be a african anatomy in the way that they own history . </s>
so we &apos;ve got these awful <unk> idea . </s>
and if we faced with a body that &apos;s actually a very different thing , to put it back in the back of these <unk> . </s>
so we have a lot of <unk> ideas about <unk> . </s>
and our nation is really based on a very different concept of <unk> . </s>
now you can imagine how amazing it is , if children are born , the two people in a body are , you know , they &apos;re in a body , and they &apos;re a body , and they &apos;re a body , and you &apos;re a body , you can see , in a body , you know , are you know two people are in a body .
where i had had the most interesting in the past was the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> last year , the gender of gender <unk> in berlin , who was asked in berlin . </s>
many journalists , me , i ask me to the question , &quot; which you &apos;ll make us , whether that <unk> <unk> <unk> or religion is ? &quot; </s>
and i had to clarify the journalists to clarify that there &apos;s not that test . </s>
we know that gender is complicated , that we &apos;ve got to admit that the nature of nature for us , that nature doesn &apos;t exist between the natural and female and <unk> ; we &apos;re the ones we have that , that &apos;s the most powerful thing . </s>
so we have a situation where the more advanced people we have to be more , we have to be more , which is really easy to create a <unk> way to create a permanent <unk> way to create a lot more <unk> to create a lot more nuanced , when we &apos;ve been adopted . </s>
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender . </s>
it applies to fall in terms of race , which is more complicated than our <unk> margin . </s>
we celebrated our hands on our hands , but we put it in all kinds of forms . </s>
we make sure that we &apos;ve coated at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees . </s>
what do we need to do with the fact that we just have a few <unk> of them in the world ? </s>
while we continue to continue our science , we &apos;re becoming increasingly becoming more , increasingly , increasingly , increasingly , we have to recognize that the most <unk> categories that we had become . </s>
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life . </s>
the areas that we see in the <unk> , in our current today , in the current united states , the fighting in the united states , the <unk> of the onset of life . </s>
we have tough conversations about what dot to people , that &apos;s how he &apos;s got another thing as a living life . </s>
we have very difficult to say -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question , when somebody &apos;s dead . </s>
our ancestors had never been to fight when somebody was dead . </s>
they &apos;ve got somebody brought up a feather underneath the nose , and if you &apos;re a <unk> , they haven &apos;t been buried . </s>
if you didn &apos;t get more , you have a <unk> . </s>
but today , we &apos;re now in a situation where we want to take people &apos;s growing structures and they want to share with people . </s>
and as a result , we &apos;re faced with the fight with the really difficult question , when somebody &apos;s dead , and that &apos;s not able to make us a really hard way in which we don &apos;t have more so much about it as simple as the earlier . </s>
well , you might expect that all of the meal of categories , someone really would really happy . </s>
i &apos;m political <unk> , i &apos;m making people living with the <unk> , but i must admit , it &apos;s frightening . </s>
to understand that these categories are really much more than we thought , &quot; i &apos;m sorry . </s>
and it makes me that in terms of the democracy , and it makes me . </s>
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to get first to be first , i &apos;ve got a big fan of the founding . </s>
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great . </s>
i find that they were so <unk> and so strong , and so radically , in the world , in which i was going to see all the few years , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is completely . </s>
it &apos;s because of the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> . </s>
the way they were <unk> to the original activists , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so much . </s>
what she was called a <unk> concept , and they were doing it by a different , and it was radical , and the only 200 years for us . </s>
as you all remember , the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy were over a very specific concept of anatomy . </s>
the masters of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the owner . </s>
they had a concept of blood blood . </s>
they were the notion that people who had political power , these political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the father , for the father of the father , for the son , and so on . </s>
the founding poetry had this idea back and they &apos;re doing a new <unk> concept , and this concept that all people were being created by the people . </s>
they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> and decided that , as a result , the commonalities that doesn &apos;t have the difference , and that was very radical . </s>
now , they did that part of a <unk> system , in which two things in common . </s>
it grew out , but at the same time , the science grew up too . </s>
if you look at the story of the story , clearly , many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world . </s>
they went away from the explanations of explanations , and they &apos;ve done things like a <unk> concept of power , back , back , where the transmission of a very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
they moved to a <unk> concept . </s>
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature . </s>
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature . </s>
they talk about power of natural history to say who we are . </s>
and as part of it , it &apos;s a concept that we have told us a concept of <unk> . </s>
and so they really have a really wonderful way to do the future . </s>
they weren &apos;t so concerned about it , but what they did for us . </s>
so what happened ? </s>
for example , the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the founding that the founding that , that anatomical anatomical is more important than the anatomical , and they say that sub-saharan <unk> , the thing that &apos;s going to say , is that anatomic more important , as a result , the right thing to be , and said , &quot; we should not have the <unk> to avoid
and women are successful . </s>
next was the successful civil rights , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s about <unk> , &quot; i am not a woman ? &quot; </s>
we find men in the <unk> <unk> , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot; </s>
again , people skin , who are in anatomical <unk> of <unk> , and again , successful . </s>
we see the same thing at the same time . </s>
of course , the problem is that , we &apos;re starting to look at all the commonalities , we have to ask ourselves why we are going to live together . </s>
well , the other day , i want to get certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture . </s>
i want to say a fish , just like a human being . </s>
i don &apos;t want to say that we should shatter the anatomy of the anatomy . </s>
i don &apos;t want to say that the <unk> should be informed consent to sex or to get to get married . </s>
so there &apos;s some anatomic <unk> that make me think , and that we are , i think , should be . </s>
but the challenge is to figure out what it is , and why we keep them , and why we keep them , and if they &apos;re doing it . </s>
so let &apos;s come back to the two of the <unk> of the speech , ok . </s>
we have two creatures , both of the two of the day , <unk> . </s>
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months , three months , they &apos;re born at the one of 1980 . </s>
in the other hand , the <unk> is born , so he &apos;s at the one march , and he &apos;s been born at the one march , and he &apos;s born at a march of 1980 , it &apos;s a march of 1980 , and he was born , was born , was born , born , &quot; he was born , born , &quot; he was born ,
except for the fact that maria three months was born , they put all the kinds of bacteria three months ago -- the right way to have a very <unk> activity to be right to drink the right . </s>
in all , you have to wait all this , not because it actually has another biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth . </s>
we find other kinds of things that are your rights . </s>
in the same time , because he &apos;s got to be <unk> , although he &apos;s not told that he &apos;s <unk> , and since i said that he &apos;s going to be , he can go up , what is going to worry about . </s>
maria , not in all the states , not in all the states , the <unk> in all states has led to marry that . </s>
in the state of state , a woman can marry , but maria can marry only in a few states today . </s>
so we &apos;ve created these kinds of <unk> categories that are predictable and questionable . </s>
and for me , what are we going to do , because our science is doing that we have to admit that a democracy that could make a democracy that could be on anatomy ? </s>
i don &apos;t want to give the science of the science , but it feels like that science is sometimes as if science is . </s>
so where do we go ? </s>
it seems like our culture , &quot; well we need to pull a line somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot; </s>
but a lot of people are beginning to be in a very strange position . </s>
so for example , texas , texas , texas , has decided that a man is to marry that you have no choice , and a woman means that you have a y chromosome . </s>
now in practice , people don &apos;t want to test their chromosome . </s>
but it &apos;s also a very bizarre because of the history that i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> . </s>
if we &apos;re going to look at the founding of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he &apos;s in his &quot; i &apos;ve a dream of a dream of a solution . </s>
he says , we should not punish people to &quot; your skin , but after the character of their character , judge , and it &apos;s so much about anatomy . </s>
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot; </s>
but how do you do that in practice ? </s>
how do you get people living on their <unk> ? </s>
i want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re right now to be right in terms of people , because i have to admit that i have a series of <unk> that i know a series of <unk> more likely than some people i know . </s>
i want to say that i probably know some bright <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more inclusive and <unk> decisions to make sexual relationships than some of the <unk> that i know . </s>
so how do we do the question of the character , the question of nature ? </s>
it turns out that it &apos;s really difficult . </s>
and part of me was wondering what if the content was something that would be in the future , could be done in the future ? </s>
do we really want to go into this direction ? </s>
i &apos;m not sure where we go . </s>
what i know is that it really matter to think about the idea that the united states is still , is thinking about questions . </s>
in our early school , we &apos;ve done our thing right now , and i think we would do our thing in the future . </s>
we don &apos;t have the situation , like this , like this , for example , where a man is <unk> to the other men , it &apos;s ready to be a <unk> , which is it &apos;s ready to be alive . </s>
but we don &apos;t exist . </s>
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have this -- a surgeon i spoke about a few years ago , who had a bunch of <unk> twins , who had a bunch of <unk> twins , and to separate them , partly to make a name . </s>
but when i <unk> him , and he asked why he did this surgeries -- it was highly disgusting operations -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be treated very badly , these kids were treated for a bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it . </s>
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political asylum in the department instead of getting a surgery in the department of a surgery to separate them ? &quot; </s>
the united states provide tremendous choices to allow people to be able to be able to be able to be able to change the state of the state . </s>
so i think we have to be wise . </s>
well , just to realize i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked about the fathers of dads . </s>
and i want to think about the possibility of life , or something that could be , if we had the mothers more involved . </s>
and i want to say something that &apos;s a feminist thing for an feminist , and that &apos;s where i think there could be different kinds of anatomy , the <unk> of anatomy , <unk> when people are hallucinating . </s>
for years , i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in the world of <unk> research . </s>
and one of the things that i really found really interesting is the difference between men and women in ways , as they think and in the world . </s>
what we &apos;ve made from <unk> studies is that women , in the average -- more social relationships and the most people who are in the most difficult for people who are vulnerable to blame within group . </s>
and so if we think about this , we have a very interesting situation we do about it . </s>
years ago , when i was a graduate student , asked me one of my favorite who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at me as a feminist , so i do it . </s>
he said , &quot; say what &apos;s feminism , what &apos;s most of feminism . &quot; </s>
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
in feminism , it &apos;s about gender , that &apos;s why there &apos;s nothing <unk> -- <unk> . </s>
but the more i thought about his question , to be so much that there was something called the feminism of feminism . </s>
this is what it &apos;s supposed to say is something that might be a little bit of male brains of what &apos;s causing us to make social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> social relationships . </s>
so where the founding drivers were extremely strong , as individuals in the state of individuals , it &apos;s possible to be able to be able to figure out that if we could use more mothers in this concept , we have more a concept of <unk> , not just as you &apos;re doing , but how we can &apos;t care for each other . </s>
and maybe where we &apos;re going to go through democracy , if we democracy democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies of view , which means to think of communicating and more about relationships . </s>
so that if we try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase . </s>
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do is a very senior public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> . </s>
i love it to any opportunity to any chance to find some extent , and they &apos;re also able to photograph into this past and too . </s>
but i &apos;m not buy anything . </s>
i get my clothes from your hand , on <unk> and <unk> . </s>
ooh , thank you . </s>
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment and also the back on my purse . </s>
i &apos;m meeting all kinds of people ; my dollars used for usual , i &apos;m looking out of it , and it makes it to my personal personal instrument . </s>
i mean , what am i going to find today ? </s>
is it <unk> ? </s>
am i going to like ? </s>
20 dollars ? </s>
if all the answers , when you feel , i feel like i won as if i was . </s>
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for these exciting week here at ted . </s>
i mean , what do someone else &apos;s going to do with that <unk> ? </s>
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;m going to do . </s>
i &apos;ve got seven of the middle of the underwear , and that &apos;s all . </s>
and then , in the same week , everything i did in my suitcase . </s>
i &apos;ve got the other way everything i might want to wear , if i just did once again , if i just wanted to go to palm springs . </s>
and i haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman who found here at ted in your home -- meaning , i &apos;ve found a few things . </s>
and i want to show you my baseline for these week . </s>
sounds like this ? </s>
while i do that , i &apos;m going to tell you some of the lessons that i believe , whether you believe it or not , from these <unk> , nothing new . </s>
let &apos;s start with sunday . </s>
i call that car . </s>
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look at great . </s>
it can always be great than 50 dollars . </s>
this whole outfit , including the coke , i &apos;ve been touched me to 55 , and it was the most expensive thing i &apos;ve carried in this whole week . </s>
monday : color is a little bit . </s>
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing a <unk> pants . </s>
if you &apos;re happy , you pull up other people . </s>
tuesday , totally enveloped <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time my life trying to try and try and see me at the same time . </s>
be just like they are . </s>
if you were to deal with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it , they &apos;re going to estimate . </s>
wednesday : embracing your intellectual child . </s>
sometimes i &apos;m saying , i looked like i am , i or i believe you attach to their <unk> . </s>
and i &apos;d like to say , &quot; thank you . &quot; </s>
thursday : the confidence is the key . </s>
if you think you see something good , it &apos;s almost safe . </s>
and if you think they &apos;re not good , you &apos;ve probably got to be right . </s>
i grew up with a mother that i did for a day . </s>
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means . </s>
and i &apos;m going to wrap this for you . </s>
if you believe that they &apos;re inside and you &apos;re a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear . </s>
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience . </s>
we should be able to do anything we want . </s>
thank you . </s>
friday : one universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> <unk> . </s>
and finally , i was making a low-cost , unique style , is a great way to tell the world a great way of a word without a word . </s>
it became always kept and over again , when people were standing on me , just because of what i was wearing , and i was great conversations . </s>
clearly , this is not all the things in my tiny . </s>
so before i go to the first thing , i &apos;ll give this all over the time . </s>
because the lesson that i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to be connected . </s>
i don &apos;t have to emotionally <unk> , because the same is going to be the same , <unk> <unk> , which just seemed to me , if i love a little bit of love in the heart , and it &apos;s looking for . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
thank you . </s>
good afternoon , everyone together . </s>
i &apos;ve just want to show you . </s>
think that as a <unk> , as flying <unk> . </s>
this is what we call our lab , <unk> design . </s>
let me tell you a little bit about this . </s>
if you take this picture -- i &apos;m a <unk> italian , and every guy in italy , and every guy in italy , and the reason i show you this is that i &apos;m showing you this is a very interesting thing in the last several decades . </s>
so , sometime ago , when you wanted to win a formula to win a formula to win her budget and put it on a good driver , and a good car . </s>
and when the car drivers , and the driver &apos;s good enough , they won &apos;t . </s>
now today , you need to take you , if you &apos;re going to win a race , actually , like this -- something like this -- something like this -- something that &apos;s going to pass information to the system , that information is going to pass on the system , that information is going to send to send and things in real time . </s>
this would you like , in <unk> , a <unk> call . </s>
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> . </s>
what &apos;s interesting about is that is the <unk> beginning of our lives . </s>
our cities were over the last few years , right now , with networks and electronics . </s>
they &apos;re going to be in free . </s>
and as computer in free , they start to react to other ways , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> and thrown out . </s>
if we <unk> , it &apos;s actually a big deal . </s>
just by the way , i want to mention cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there . </s>
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions . </s>
so if we make something that is a big deal . </s>
and beyond the cities , all this is the gap and put it into objects of the everyday life . </s>
this is from a show that was paola for the field of the year in the year , during the summer , organized . </s>
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
now all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us . </s>
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there , a sensor and a <unk> . </s>
and that changes the interaction that we &apos;re going to have people with our environment . </s>
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of the old dream of the old dream of space . </s>
you know , when the moses came out , is it that he &apos;s going to be the hammer , and it &apos;s on the end , and i said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , why not you feel ? &quot; why not you &apos;re not ? &quot; </s>
now , today , our environment , for the first time , to us . </s>
i &apos;m going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment , and it &apos;s going to be . </s>
let &apos;s start with the rock . </s>
now the first project i want to imagine is to introduce you to the truth of one of our first . </s>
it was a 6 years ago . </s>
and what we did was actually a very recent kind of network that was used to use in the entire world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and <unk> information from this network that the <unk> may be <unk> to understand how the city works . </s>
the summer was a very summer -- 2006 . </s>
it was a <unk> <unk> . </s>
some of you remember , it was <unk> , and then the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> . </s>
and no matter , italy on the end of the end . </s>
now , you see what happens on this day , just the following of activity that happens in the network . </s>
here &apos;s the city . </s>
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . </s>
at the morning , the game . </s>
you see the timeline . </s>
early afternoon , people here and there that &apos;s moving , and they move . </s>
this is the game starts to -- in fact . </s>
france makes a gateway . italy is a gateway . </s>
<unk> , people make a quick call on toilet . </s>
second <unk> . the end of normal people . </s>
first of the first one , second . </s>
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> . </s>
italy wins . </s>
now in this night , went to celebrate all the center to celebrate . </s>
they saw the big . </s>
the next day , all the time to make the <unk> and the prime minister to meet the prime minister time . </s>
and then all the other ones . </s>
you see the image of the <unk> <unk> , where , for the professional time , people are going to celebrate a big party , and you see the actual thing that day . </s>
now , this is just one example of how we can feel today , in a way , in a way we could not have a few years ago . </s>
again , quickly , another example of what &apos;s going on : here &apos;s not about people , but to consume things that we use and consume . </s>
well , now we know where our things are coming . </s>
this is a map that tells you all the chips , which is a mac computer , like they came together . </s>
but we know little about where the things go . </s>
so we designed some small markers to track the trash of the system , as he &apos;s going to go through the system . </s>
so we embarked with some volunteers , which tells us , in seattle , in seattle , helped have helped things that they <unk> -- different kinds of things , as you can see , things that they would throw the otherwise . </s>
then we have the little ones that are little brands to track the trash of the trash , on the trash of the trash . </s>
here are the results we &apos;ve just got to do . </s>
on the seattle , seattle . </s>
after a week . </s>
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system . </s>
we can make the same things in the fact . </s>
the data were not available . </s>
but that &apos;s what happens is a lot of <unk> <unk> and complicated things . </s>
the other thing is , we believe that when we see that when we see that , that we &apos;re going to throw away , not just that they &apos;re still on the planet . </s>
and the plastic that we still stay every day . </s>
and if we were going to show that people , we can do a change for a behavior . </s>
so this is the reason for this project . </s>
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could you have a lot more about the power and the many other things that you can do with , but i want to talk about the second part that we can do with a very beginning , and that &apos;s the most primitive of our environment . </s>
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain . </s>
it was starting to one of the <unk> of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> had a nice tradition , to bring public spaces to use water . </s>
and the question was : how could you create technology , new technology ? </s>
and one of the ideas that ended up with in a <unk> <unk> , imagine , imagine these <unk> , and valves , <unk> , valves , valves , <unk> , and closing . </s>
they &apos;re making a <unk> of water , and it &apos;s like a <unk> . </s>
if these <unk> , can you write patterns , pictures , images , text . </s>
and you can go to him , and it &apos;s going to open up open to make them feel <unk> , like you can see on this slide . </s>
well , we &apos;ve launched the mayor of <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s very amused . </s>
and we got a building a building in the expo that &apos;s the expo to design the expo . </s>
we called it the digital water . </s>
that &apos;s the building of water . </s>
there &apos;s no <unk> or windows , but if you &apos;re going to approach it , it &apos;s going to open up and make it happen . </s>
and that was also covered with water . </s>
and if you &apos;re feeling that if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even let the roof down . </s>
or you could just intuit the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that days , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve got the building . &quot; </s>
no , they don &apos;t mean that the building is just so that the architecture is disappearing . </s>
and here &apos;s how the building works . </s>
you see the person who wonder what happens inside . </s>
and here &apos;s what i was trying to do was trying to test the water that the water covers they were not going to be wet . </s>
well , i should tell you what one night is when all of these sensors . </s>
but actually , it was a wider , very much fun . </s>
all children from <unk> came to the building , because the way she played with building was completely different . </s>
no longer a building that would open them , but a building that &apos;s still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump to jump . </s>
and that was , for us , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , as designers , engineers , as designers , the people , the things that we &apos;re designing . </s>
but the reality is always over . </s>
and that &apos;s the beauty of making things that are being used and with people . </s>
this is a picture of the building blocks of the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the rest of it . </s>
and this is what we &apos;ve got to do about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you . </s>
imagine this <unk> could really start to fly . </s>
imagine you might have a little bit of helicopters that are flying through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> <unk> <unk> -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space . </s>
here &apos;s the video . </s>
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you &apos;ve seen before you saw with other moves , totally soft life . </s>
you can have these cloud . </s>
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or ad , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions . </s>
or more importantly , in three dimensions , which is , the light , is not the position of the fittest . </s>
you can play with different ways . </s>
imagine the screen just in different <unk> or pick in different <unk> or pick in different <unk> . </s>
but then , this could only be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can and move them through the way they can move through , you can see it through many , many ways can see . </s>
here &apos;s a real <unk> to shape as a <unk> arrangement around how before they had a <unk> preventive concept . </s>
so if you turn the light , it looks like this . so , as we &apos;ve seen it before . </s>
imagine that every single one of people is being run . </s>
it could be implanted every single person to have people who come from , from the movements of people or so . </s>
i want to show you here , you know , here &apos;s a little bit . </s>
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> <unk> of our time -- the <unk> <unk> of our time -- the <unk> <unk> of our time -- and we &apos;ve got his movements into 3d , to use them as an impulse for the <unk> . </s>
this is <unk> dancing . </s>
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations . </s>
it &apos;s actually a <unk> and a <unk> . </s>
so that you can actually move the whole movement . </s>
you can make this whole time . </s>
but then , if we all have a cochlear implant , you can play with color and play with color and play it . </s>
and this is what we want to use as a potential to use for the <unk> . </s>
i want to work with you the latest project . </s>
it &apos;s something we work for the olympics for the olympics for the olympics . </s>
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud . </s>
the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re trying to do this , that again , that we &apos;re trying to do something to do things , almost like that , as we call it , <unk> , like you move a <unk> , but with a cloud . </s>
imagine that every one is a little bit of a <unk> for a <unk> . </s>
i think that &apos;s remarkable of the last one of the last one of the last one of the last one of the last one of the last decades , that we are from a physical digital world . </s>
it has been picking up everything , and it makes it available by the internet . </s>
today , we can take the first time -- and the campaign has demonstrated that -- can we have to be from the digital world , from the <unk> global , the networks is changing the physical world . </s>
that &apos;s where we &apos;re using it to design and make it really to create a symbol . </s>
this is something that &apos;s built in the city . </s>
but tomorrow , it can be implanted for us to provide the challenges -- think about climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we change the digital world in the physical world . </s>
so the idea is that we actually bring people to engage things in the things that they do things . </s>
the cloud is back to a cloud of <unk> , in the same way , a real cloud of a cloud , it &apos;s a cloud . </s>
and these particles are water , whereas our cloud is a cloud of <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s a physical <unk> in london , but with <unk> <unk> . </s>
and you can move inside and different kinds of experiences . </s>
you can actually look at the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> and the way , and it &apos;s as kind of connection to community . </s>
so , both of the physical cloud in the sky , and something that they can go back and see how to new new <unk> . </s>
you can go . </s>
and a kind of digital urban <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody that are going to go to the top . </s>
thank you . </s>
and as an artist , i really think of connection . </s>
by my work , i &apos;m trying to say that people are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected . </s>
the first time i was 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m focused on awe . </s>
my heart was , when i was trying to tell my head , i was trying to grab my head . </s>
the earth around me is 60 meters of water , and i couldn &apos;t wonder that this one could charge in a different way to be a year . </s>
be in the same as a calf or by <unk> , they break out of <unk> . </s>
each of these iceberg has shifted its own individual personality . </s>
they interact with all your surroundings and their experience . </s>
some people have to get up to the bitter end , whereas others is not nearly anymore and in a very passionate <unk> . </s>
if you look at a iceberg , you think about it , separated and just like we see humans . </s>
but the truth is far away . </s>
while a iceberg , i <unk> his <unk> machine . </s>
during the iceberg , he puts <unk> drinking water , that &apos;s a lot of forms . </s>
i &apos;m going to be the <unk> of the puzzle as well as i was going to be portraits , in consciousness , that they were in these individual moments , and never like that . </s>
it &apos;s not death , if you melt , it &apos;s not a , but a <unk> of your <unk> , the life cycle . </s>
a part of the ice in the <unk> , i &apos;m very young -- a couple thousand years old . </s>
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old . </s>
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i would like to go into <unk> in greenland . </s>
very rarely , you actually chased the witness of a <unk> iceberg . </s>
so here you see it . </s>
on the left , you see a little boat . </s>
this is about five feet long . </s>
please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the <unk> . </s>
you can see here , it starts to roll and the boat has moved on the other side , the man sitting there . </s>
this is the average size of a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s sticking about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters . </s>
and this video is in real time . </s>
and just like this , you see them a different side of its identity . </s>
thank you . </s>
my life is really extraordinary , in terms of some amazing projects . </s>
but in the coolest , i &apos;ve ever been working on this guy . </s>
his name is <unk> . </s>
<unk> was one of the leading commanders of the world . </s>
then one day , he came back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs were <unk> . &quot; </s>
and that was the eruption of the system . </s>
<unk> is completely paralyzed . </s>
he can use your eyes . </s>
i was standing . </s>
i have a company , which design and animations , graffiti is vital part of the <unk> of what we admire and look at the pacific . </s>
we &apos;ve decided to support tony -- <unk> , and his thing . </s>
i met with his dad and his brother and said , &quot; we are going to give you this money to give you this money . </s>
what do you want to do with it ? &quot; </s>
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk about tony . </s>
i want to talk to him and i asked , &quot; wait , &quot; right now , i &apos;m not -- i saw this -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot; </s>
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve coated to hear the higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that . </s>
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot; </s>
and i said , &quot; how do you do it ? &quot; </s>
somebody has seen the film and <unk> , &quot; well . </s>
so they communicate it -- that &apos;s how they run your fingers . </s>
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can it be ? &quot; </s>
so i came to the need , just a check out of the <unk> , and i asked a check that i had not the slightest idea of how i should be <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m interested in places and imagine his brother and his father -- with words , &quot; good , we &apos;ll talk to a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to find a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way to make his art . </s>
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s going to be in itself , it &apos;s not going to communicate . &quot; </s>
i was talking about a conference at one conference . </s>
i met these guys , graffiti research , and they have a technology that allows them to draw a light on the arbitrarily surface , and then with a <unk> meeting , which is just the negative surface . </s>
so they &apos;re going to pull around and make it more polite . </s>
they say that all of those things that are up there , a <unk> follow . </s>
it starts with the speed of the speed of the <unk> , then the <unk> and the last thing that people actually do art . </s>
but there was always a <unk> in their presentation . </s>
so i went home and went to my wife and went with my wife , and told her , and we thought , &quot; well , second time there is a laser way to drive things , then we should be able to find a laser , so that it could make the <unk> , that would be awesome . &quot; </s>
that was the beginning of the journey . </s>
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have some things . </s>
first , we put the doors , and actually , for a <unk> , they get a machine that he can communicate with communicating -- a stephen <unk> . </s>
that was incredible . </s>
and he &apos;s really extremely miserable -- i call him <unk> , because you talk about it , because you talk to him , or gets an email , and i &apos;m so excited about this guy is incredible . &quot; </s>
and we &apos;ve been seven programmers from all over the world -- literally -- literally , from all the most of all the world &apos;s most part of the world -- to home . </s>
my wife , my kids and i are in the garage , and these hacker and programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . </s>
many of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and that we were <unk> and all the images to be <unk> <unk> . </s>
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my kids got to be , and we &apos;re trying to do this . </s>
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description . </s>
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something more insidious and a few things from the <unk> and the <unk> . </s>
we took a <unk> , they <unk> , they <unk> , they &apos;ve got a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to you , we &apos;ve got to charge the code , we have to download code free , which is the software you can download download . </s>
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely freely from constraints . </s>
no insurance can be <unk> , and you can &apos;t get it to the <unk> , and you can &apos;t get it back to the surface of the time , but you can &apos;t get it back to the surface of the time , but you can &apos;t get it back to the surface of the time , but you can &apos;t get it back to the surface of the
no hospital . </s>
any of you , but every single person can actually communicate with his eyes or draw . </s>
thank you . </s>
thank you very much , that was incredible . </s>
at the end of two weeks , we went back to <unk> . </s>
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room . </s>
there &apos;s all of these <unk> before the big bang of the big bang of the big bang we are in the big universe . </s>
and after about a year of planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , tony &apos;s been slandered , tony for the first time , tony &apos;s been back to seven years . </s>
and this is an actual image because this is his life , and it &apos;s about his life support system . </s>
we have a bed , so it can go outside , so it can go outside . </s>
we have a ping-pong system against the wall of the hospital . </s>
and he drew over again , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking feeling . </s>
<unk> , we had to put in the parking lot , we felt felt that we were doing brilliantly as a part of the fittest . </s>
at the end , he asked a email , &quot; for the first time i &apos;ve been doing something that i &apos;ve been doing something . </s>
i feel , i was going to get underwater underwater and finally , and finally , somebody moved down to the bottom and my head can breathe . &quot; </s>
isn &apos;t that ? </s>
this is something like our <unk> . </s>
that holds us to the power and continue to continue to continue to continue . </s>
and we have to improve much of this device . </s>
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> right now . </s>
and somebody who has to have a more empowered potential , deserves a lot more . </s>
so we are , trying to figure out how to make it faster , faster and stronger . </s>
since that time we have all sorts of recognition . </s>
we &apos;ve won a few awards . </s>
think it &apos;s free , no one &apos;s beginning to be . </s>
it &apos;s all of our own pockets . </s>
so the awards were fantastic . &quot; </s>
armstrong and <unk> over us and then , in december , we &apos;ve seen the <unk> , when one of the 50 was a <unk> invention of the world , what was really great . </s>
the <unk> is -- and that includes the circle of -- that it &apos;s the whole circle -- that it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> in the middle of los angeles , called &quot; the kind of the <unk> . &quot; </s>
and there are just the toughest <unk> of the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there . </s>
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is quite a lot of it . </s>
so basically , when you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you make it possible . </s>
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible . </s>
do it possible -- they all agree here . </s>
i &apos;m not a programmer and had never been doing anything to do with <unk> , but i just got a little bit , and i &apos;ve been doing something i &apos;ve been surrounded with amazing people with this , so we could put something more . </s>
and these questions should be connected by you and that &apos;s going to be a little bit about each other day , which is done , and if not now , when you &apos;re not going to go ? and if i don &apos;t , who &apos;s going to be ? </s>
thank you . </s>
so i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america america &apos;s most powerful <unk> . </s>
and i say that people always want to come to a scientist . </s>
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but no one has ever been chosen for farmers . </s>
today today , i want to tell you about it and a little bit . </s>
well , a epiphany of enlightenment is to date that you find it because you drop it anywhere . </s>
you go to the block and take it out . </s>
this is a painting of a circle . </s>
one of my friends have made it -- richard <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s the kind of complicated that i want to tell you today . </s>
my circle began to the 1960s at the high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> . </s>
i was the one who was the one week in the <unk> green and blue was beaten up until a schoolteacher my life . </s>
she saved my life , by using me the toilet . </s>
this was what she secretly was secretly , and she was secretly . </s>
it did three years , and it did three years . </s>
and i had to do that . </s>
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it &apos;s also taken me to san francisco , i found a lover -- and then i found a work at the 1980s , i found it really important to <unk> . </s>
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , wife , woman , <unk> , who said , &quot; i have to see them . </s>
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as adults . </s>
can you roll the south <unk> , and please come together with the man i know that they &apos;ve found it . </s>
and i should mention that i was <unk> , and i want you to be able to please go . &quot; </s>
well , the next day we were in cleveland . </s>
we looked at them , we laughed , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice . </s>
we took one for them , and we &apos;re trying to do them , and we gave them to their family , because it was necessary to eight times because it was necessary . </s>
it was something that we knew . </s>
and just as adults , who wanted to learn as adults , i didn &apos;t learn to learn , turned out , turned out to a box , and became my hands . </s>
what happens was that the circle was closed , it was a circle of the closed -- and i talked about it . </s>
the revelation is , death penalty of life is . </s>
she has saved my life , and my partner and i was going to have to be . </s>
and you know , this part of life takes everything else of life . </s>
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is a very shocking thing that &apos;s going to be so many . </s>
he needs just as -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to us to give these things . </s>
thank you . </s>
imagine a big blast , as they were on 1,000 feet . </s>
imagine a plane full of smoke . </s>
imagine a <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
it sounds like <unk> . </s>
well , i had a unique spot to this day ; i sat on <unk> . </s>
i was the only one who could speak with the <unk> . </s>
so i looked at the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve made a few birds . &quot; </s>
the pilot had been <unk> , and we weren &apos;t going to be very far away . </s>
you could see . </s>
two minutes later , i was at the same time . </s>
the pilot is the machine to the hudson river . </s>
that &apos;s usually not the route . </s>
he <unk> the engines . </s>
imagine a <unk> airplane . </s>
and then he said three words -- the most <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
he says , &quot; <unk> , &quot; to the <unk> of the arts . &quot; </s>
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the <unk> . </s>
i could see it in her eyes , there was a <unk> priest , the life was . </s>
i want to share three things that i learned about me on this day . </s>
i learned that in a moment , everything else is . </s>
we &apos;ve got this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to be a hand , all the fences that i wanted to do and never did . </s>
while i was going to talk about it , i remembered a saying , &quot; i &apos;m getting a little bad wines . &quot; </s>
because if the wine is about it , and the person is there , i just open it . </s>
i want to live more , and i want to live . </s>
and this urgency , has this goal , changed my life . </s>
the second thing i learned about this day , and that was when we were <unk> the george washington bridge , so much , gee , gee , i thought , &quot; i have a kind of thing that i really want to do . </s>
i had a good life . </s>
in my own humanity , and i mean , i think , better , i think , better , in everything i &apos;m going to do . </s>
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also been given my ego . </s>
and i &apos;m going to spend the time i have to do for <unk> things , with people who are doing something . </s>
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends . </s>
and then , when i was about to write , i decided to be negative energy from my life . </s>
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better . </s>
i haven &apos;t been given with my wife &apos;s wife . </s>
it feels great . </s>
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i &apos;m happy to be happy . </s>
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s where the inner clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 14 , 13 , <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot;
you can get the water . </s>
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot; </s>
i don &apos;t want to get this thing in 20 parts of the way you know it . </s>
as we get a <unk> , i think , man , man , too . </s>
almost as we prepare our lives , we prepare our lives . </s>
but it was very sad . </s>
i didn &apos;t go ; i love my life . </s>
and this sadness really is really in a thought that i &apos;m just one thing to me . </s>
i wish i could see my kids to see my kids . </s>
about a month after i visited a transaction of my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent . </s>
not yet . </s>
and i &apos;m a <unk> , i &apos;m making a little kid . </s>
and in the world , everything is a sense of me . </s>
i then realized that i was going to have the dots behind that life is just a great father . </s>
more than anything , everything else is my only one goal in life , a good father . </s>
i was the miracle of the miracle of this day . </s>
i got another present to see that in the future , and come to live and different and different . </s>
my call to everybody , which is , imagine what happened on your flight -- please not -- -- -- not -- but think it &apos;s going to be wondering , and how would they change ? </s>
what would you catch that they &apos;re controlling because they would be thinking for forever ? </s>
how would you change their relationships and the negative energy in the negative energy in it ? </s>
and more than anything else are the best parents that they can only be ? </s>
thank you . </s>
and the idea behind the <unk> is quite straightforward . </s>
we don &apos;t want to build that the bomb . </s>
the most important factor there is the development of nuclear weapons , the <unk> in <unk> . </s>
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> . </s>
so if there is to <unk> the systems , which is <unk> and valves and valves and we can actually make a lot of problems , then we can actually make lots of problems with the centrifuge . </s>
this <unk> <unk> don &apos;t walk with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology . </s>
but if we create it , a <unk> <unk> on a laptop which is used by a laptop that &apos;s used by a laptop to <unk> these gray box , then we are in the business . </s>
and this is the planning behind <unk> . </s>
we start with a <unk> . </s>
the <unk> will be smuggled into the gray box , empty the centrifuge and the iranian <unk> of the other <unk> seal . </s>
that &apos;s a <unk> , right ? </s>
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found this . </s>
when we started to <unk> our research into <unk> , six months ago , what was was completely unknown , what was the purpose of purpose and purpose . </s>
the only thing we knew , very complicated , what the most part of the <unk> , the <unk> part , he made <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
and it seemed to be a little bit of <unk> , with these brushes boxes , this <unk> <unk> . </s>
the <unk> our attention and we started a project project where we &apos;re setting up our surroundings with <unk> , and examined that . </s>
and then something weird . </s>
<unk> <unk> : a <unk> that don &apos;t touch the cheese sandwich -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat it . </s>
that made no sense of my eyes . </s>
and after we &apos;ve had different strains , i was told that this is an immoral attack . </s>
and completely completely on a specific . </s>
the <unk> <unk> active on the gray box , if a special configuration discovered : even when the heart program that we &apos;re trying to try to try to focus on this goal . </s>
and if not , then it does nothing . </s>
so , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , i was almost about the clock , because i thought , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s the goal . </s>
it could say , say , a <unk> american power plant , or a <unk> in germany . </s>
so we should find out what the goal is doing . </s>
so we <unk> the <unk> code , and found out that it &apos;s in two digital warheads in two digital warheads in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger . </s>
and we also noticed that they were very professional , of people who all had the obvious information available to the other . </s>
they knew the architect and <unk> that they had to make . </s>
probably , they &apos;re even the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
so they knew everything . </s>
and if you &apos;ve been told , the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for themselves . </s>
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen . </s>
here you see a clip from this <unk> code . </s>
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines . </s>
it &apos;s like <unk> <unk> . </s>
and i want to tell you how we were able to become from this code to become on this code . </s>
so what we were doing was <unk> <unk> , because we know what these are going to do . </s>
and then we searched and <unk> and trying to bring this with the physical world in relation to the physical world -- with potential goals in the world . </s>
so we needed theories about this goals that we could have or educating . </s>
to have this theories , we call <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it has to be very likely to be in iran because there &apos;s been the most infections . </s>
well , in this area , there &apos;s not thousands of thousands of goals . </s>
basically , it &apos;s going to be on the <unk> , and on the <unk> in <unk> . </s>
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to give me a list of all the experts for <unk> and <unk> . &quot; </s>
and i called them and <unk> to her expertise to compare their expertise to compare their expertise in the code and the data we found in the code . </s>
and that worked very well . </s>
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> to the <unk> in relation to the <unk> . </s>
the world &apos;s part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see . </s>
and if you &apos;re the speed of this <unk> , you actually think it &apos;s able to crack the rotor and eventually even that <unk> explode . </s>
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually beginning to let it slowly and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow in trying to make it <unk> , so that they couldn &apos;t be able to get to the <unk> . </s>
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of the <unk> by looking at very precise data and <unk> . </s>
so for example , the number of <unk> are very much like this code ; you can &apos;t miss it . </s>
i started studying scientific literature , about how these <unk> were built in <unk> and found found that they are structured , and each <unk> are <unk> <unk> . </s>
so that &apos;s made sense to do it together . </s>
and it &apos;s been better . </s>
these <unk> are broken in 15 cycles of levels . </s>
and guess what we found in the <unk> ? </s>
a <unk> structure . </s>
so again , this really well , really well . </s>
and this gave us big confidence for that , which we &apos;re doing here . </s>
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just do this . </s>
these results were achieved by several weeks of work . </s>
and we often ran in a perfect , and we had to take us . </s>
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually on a and the same destination , but from different directions , but from different directions . </s>
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> and slowed down and down and down the big <unk> in interaction with six <unk> in interactions and manipulated . </s>
so in the big , we &apos;re very hopeful , we actually have a lot of fact , what &apos;s the goal . </s>
it &apos;s just <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> . </s>
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other desirable goals might be hit by <unk> . </s>
so here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has really been designed to be a <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s the gray box , and above it &apos;s just looking at the <unk> . </s>
now , what this thing is , that it &apos;s the prime values of sensors -- so for example , for example , for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s code , that &apos;s still the code that has been the attack , with the wrong data , it &apos;s going to be with false . </s>
and actually this false <unk> , the <unk> has been recognized before . </s>
so it &apos;s like as in <unk> , where during the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ? </s>
the idea of the time is not just the <unk> in the middle of the control . </s>
in fact , it &apos;s much more powerful and it &apos;s <unk> . </s>
the idea is to be a digital <unk> . </s>
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> isn &apos;t fast enough to respond to quickly . </s>
so in a power , when the big <unk> is going to quickly , you have to be <unk> inside of you open up . </s>
of course , this cannot be done by a human being done . </s>
so we need digital <unk> . </s>
and when the dishes are , they can really really bad . </s>
this is a <unk> . </s>
and not the <unk> , even the <unk> is going to notice . </s>
this is frightening . </s>
but it &apos;s even worse . </s>
and what i &apos;m saying is very important . </s>
think about it . this is <unk> . </s>
he has not designed anything to do with <unk> , with <unk> . </s>
so he would take me exactly as well -- in a power plant , or a power plant , or in a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> . </s>
and you don &apos;t have to -- you have to be the <unk> , you have to not have the <unk> of a <unk> , as we &apos;ve seen it in <unk> . </s>
and you could use the ordinary <unk> technology to spread . </s>
it &apos;s just like to spread like this . </s>
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask . </s>
so unfortunately , the greatest number of goals for that &apos;s attacks , not in the middle east . </s>
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan . </s>
so all these green areas are the <unk> environments . </s>
we need to ask ourselves the consequences and we start to be able to do better . </s>
thank you . </s>
i have a question . </s>
ralph , it was very much about the people who think that the <unk> is the <unk> behind the <unk> . </s>
is that this is your mind ? </s>
okay , you want to know that ? </s>
yeah . okay . </s>
my mind is involved , but the driving force is not israel . </s>
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower . </s>
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , thankfully , thankfully . </s>
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger . </s>
thank you , that you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> . thank you . </s>
i &apos;ve spent the last few years to do this in a way that normally inhabit place , which usually usually be very difficult and at the same time . </s>
i went into prison -- difficult . </s>
i &apos;ve been working on in a <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ve been filming in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous . </s>
and i &apos;ve spent 30 days with this , nothing like this , but a little bit difficult in the middle , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end . </s>
i actually have the most part of my career in my career , and all of the attempt to investigate all the attempt to investigate the public school and interesting , and hopefully hope to a kind of sense , what they &apos;re compelling and makes it to be doing for the public . </s>
so when i knew i come to come here to look at me in a tedtalk , and i knew i &apos;d do something else a little bit different . </s>
some of you may have heard of this a couple of weeks ago , and i &apos;ve got a ad on ebay . </s>
i &apos;m a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the ability to <unk> the <unk> to my tedtalk . </s>
really , some of the people are hiring and companies , <unk> and <unk> , who &apos;s unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson , because i &apos;m sure chris anderson at the time -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson , and not many clues to what was going to be really going to be . </s>
so what you got was : my tedtalk , you know what the subject is going to be the ears , especially if i &apos;m your own company for your participation to deliver your company . </s>
but it &apos;s apart , it &apos;s a very good chance to do . </s>
you know how many people think about this tedtalks ? </s>
a whole lot . </s>
that &apos;s the way , the <unk> . </s>
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the <unk> . </s>
if you had asked me to have a year ago , i couldn &apos;t have been able to say you to say . </s>
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , is to investigate the world of marketing . </s>
as i said , i &apos;ve been in a very senior years to see some awful situations , but nothing could get me , not to be able to go beyond anything , and as much as i put in these guys in a room . </s>
you know , i had the idea for a movie . </s>
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , the whole film , <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising . </s>
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> . </s>
so what &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything , from the top to the end , the beginning to the bottom , the beginning to the bottom , the beginning of the <unk> , that you see from the beginning to the end , this is the brand <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
now , the <unk> center , the <unk> center , the <unk> center , the <unk> center , the <unk> center , the <unk> center , the <unk> center . </s>
these people are being connected to be connected -- forever . </s>
and so , the movie that is going to be a whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , in that forever ? </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> person . </s>
that was more to the west . </s>
it was in eternity , forever . &quot; </s>
but we &apos;re not just going to just give the brand x as a <unk> , but we &apos;ll certainly make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible will last year . </s>
so we &apos;re going to sell a shoe and he &apos;s the greatest shoe , they &apos;ve ever worn -- you &apos;ve ever heard . </s>
the brain car that you ever get the dangers , &quot; the greatest <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
so the idea is to show aside a part of life , actually , to finance the film ? </s>
and we actually show the whole process of how it works . </s>
the goal of the whole movie is transparency . </s>
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of the movie . </s>
so this is the whole concept , the whole thing , from beginning to finish . </s>
and i would be happily if you could help , and i think it would have to be . </s>
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience . </s>
i know how to be people in being being being going to be . </s>
have you -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; a negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop this ? </s>
how much money is needed to solve this ? </s>
and a little baby . </s>
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s definitely to be worth considering , some really knows the very common . </s>
who knows when the movie is , we might be able to see how a <unk> <unk> . </s>
what do you think the answer is going to be ? </s>
and the answer is probably going to be the answer &quot; no . &quot; </s>
but it &apos;s a difficult thing to do with the film or a difficult thing to me ? </s>
jk : both . </s>
so , it &apos;s not so optimistic . </s>
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help . </s>
i can help . </s>
okay . </s>
fantastic . </s>
we need to think that . </s>
yeah . </s>
if you look at the people who have to do it , and then -- to do this . </s>
there are some places we can apply to us . </s>
so , you &apos;re going to put the camera . </s>
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera that we wanted to make a <unk> . </s>
it turned out that it was actually meant to do with your movie . &quot; </s>
and just like all of these companies , one after another . </s>
no one was going to have something to do with the movie . </s>
i was astonished . </s>
they didn &apos;t want to do with the project . </s>
and i was confused , because i thought , the concept of advertising , your product of advertising , your product will be able to be able to see , there &apos;s so many people like possible . </s>
especially in the world today , in the world , in this interface , new and old media and old media and the most media media -- is it not the idea of <unk> into the <unk> that is causing the masses of the message . </s>
no , that was what i thought . </s>
but you see , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that &apos;s been recognized . </s>
actually , that wasn &apos;t the mistakes in the mistake . </s>
that would be no problem . </s>
that would be . </s>
but what this image is , is a problem . </s>
see , when you &apos;re transparency at the <unk> page , this is one of the first pictures that appears . </s>
i really like your way , sergey , sergey . </s>
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and <unk> , and the access to information , especially what is <unk> to information , especially , <unk> , especially , <unk> , and the last line -- the last line of the world population -- the final line of the world is certainly the greatest problem . </s>
you know , we hear a whole bunch of transparency . </s>
our politicians say it says , our politicians says , even our ceos . </s>
but if it &apos;s done that it &apos;s going to be implemented , it &apos;s going to change . </s>
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , the <unk> <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> . </s>
and it &apos;s also a very risky bonus . </s>
what &apos;s even more ? </s>
a whole bunch of cool food . </s>
this is very risky . </s>
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want them to be a story . </s>
we want you to make a story , but we want to just want that you &apos;re going to tell our story . &quot; </s>
so , when i was a kid and my dad who &apos;s lying in the <unk> of his own , and he sits me and looking at me and looking at me , and he sits me and looking at me and look at me -- i would say , &quot; my son is going to be in every time . </s>
there are your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot; </s>
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version . </s>
but there was only one agency , a agency , to help us -- and that &apos;s just to help us -- and that &apos;s because i had had to do it alone , i had to go to the <unk> and direct with my team . </s>
so what you &apos;re going to start to understand -- or what i was starting to understand -- was that if you start to talk to the same companies , the idea of how your brand understood , a big problem . </s>
i have friends , the big , gigantic <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends , the little bits of how i do . </s>
and my friends , the big , gigantic <unk> , say that the reason why their movies are so successful , on the <unk> lies that they have . </s>
and then they say my friends , the little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we use these big , gigantic <unk> ? </s>
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
so , as well as we are , we &apos;re seeing in the movie ? </s>
so , whenever i &apos;m going to do the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you see the <unk> . </s>
and every time i <unk> , i can say , &quot; are you going to be fresh enough for this interview ? </s>
you &apos;re so far as far as you see a little nervous . </s>
i want to help you calm down . </s>
maybe should you like to a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> . &quot; </s>
and then we offer one of these great <unk> . </s>
either &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; they &apos;re going to have the choice . </s>
we &apos;re going to be both for men than to be loaded for women , or a gold , whatever it is . </s>
this is the <unk> . </s>
now i can all ask your questions and give you a <unk> version . </s>
we &apos;re a smaller brand . </s>
so as you &apos;ve heard about the films , we &apos;re being a <unk> , we &apos;re being a <unk> . </s>
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands . </s>
so these things -- you know , remembers people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in . </s>
and what would they describe ? </s>
<unk> . </s>
this is a great question . </s>
the <unk> technology . </s>
technology is not the way to describe something that is someone under the <unk> . </s>
we talk about <unk> , fresh . </s>
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes something to make a positive , unlike the smell and humidity . &quot; </s>
it &apos;s like you . </s>
how can we hold longer fresh , make more fresh , three <unk> . </s>
these things have a <unk> effect . </s>
and this is a <unk> . </s>
what is it to me ? what is it with the <unk> ? </s>
i have to talk to the guy on the road , which are like i &apos;m wearing . </s>
they would tell me something about my brand . </s>
how would you describe your brand ? </s>
hmmm ? </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
i really would like to really find a nice clothing . </s>
the <unk> hits , except for the <unk> , except at the <unk> . </s>
well , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ? </s>
unique . </s>
i think the style , the style , i &apos;ve probably got a &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot; </s>
i like lots of black colors , lots of <unk> and so forth . </s>
but i just did a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and a stuff . </s>
if dan was a brand , he would be a classic <unk> of <unk> . </s>
man 2 : the brand that i am , is i would say , <unk> fly . </s>
woman # , julian <unk> , <unk> -- i don &apos;t know . </s>
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m going to sell all the land in the country . </s>
so i think that &apos;s my brand . </s>
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry . </s>
the man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was <unk> . </s>
5 : brand <unk> <unk> . </s>
does this happen ? </s>
i &apos;m a <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m tom . </s>
now , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i &apos;m seeing me is often the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> . </s>
and what &apos;s been noted , i was going to have a experts . </s>
i needed somebody who had my head could be able to help me understand what you called the &quot; <unk> &quot; . &quot; </s>
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
they &apos;ve companies like nucleic <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , these <unk> . </s>
if you could do it for the rest , they could help me help . </s>
they have their pictures , yeah ? </s>
i have this . the first painting is a painting of my family . </s>
just tell me a little bit about how to do with their thoughts and feelings about it . </s>
these are the people who are shaping my real . </s>
tell me about this world . </s>
<unk> : this world ? i think the world &apos;s world in which you live in -- how people are around the way to live your life , the family , the family , the work , and so forth . </s>
all of these things come together and start from a place , and for me and start with my family in west virginia . </s>
what is the next thing you want to talk about . </s>
the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life . </s>
what &apos;s going on the mind , and emotions are about them ? </s>
it &apos;s like i want to be about . </s>
i like things that are different . </s>
i like things , the <unk> are , i like that things . </s>
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do you accept it ? </s>
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what are they currently in ? </s>
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents that red ? </s>
tell me a little bit about this . </s>
a little more about you , which is not they . </s>
what other <unk> are they &apos;ve been expanding ? </s>
it &apos;s not going to be a fear . in which kind of rollercoaster are you ? </s>
<unk> ! no , thank you . </s>
thank you very much for your patience . </s>
yeah . all right . </s>
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it is . </s>
there &apos;s beautiful lots of kooks . </s>
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> had two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> / 7 / brand . </s>
and it &apos;s very good . </s>
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction . </s>
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , rather than both of them . </s>
many companies tend to do -- and this is the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re going to avoid these elements , and they turn them on themselves , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . </s>
what other things act like this ? </s>
the first one is a classic , apple . </s>
and you can see it , <unk> , mini , mini , mini <unk> and <unk> . </s>
now , there are lots of brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing . </s>
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ? </s>
if somebody would ask , your <unk> , your <unk> , how would they be ? </s>
you &apos;re a <unk> ? they &apos;re something that blood blood flow in <unk> ? </s>
or are you more likely to be a <unk> ? </s>
is you &apos;re a little bit of quiet , <unk> , <unk> , conservative ? </s>
<unk> are things that are <unk> , fresh , like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and agile , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> . </s>
or are they rather like a <unk> ? </s>
are they become a <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ? </s>
are you <unk> , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ? </s>
are they <unk> , robust , secure , sacred , <unk> , <unk> and wise like the dalai lama or <unk> . </s>
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , and the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they weren &apos;t part of the project . </s>
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film , because they don &apos;t have control over the world &apos;s music . </s>
but then , 17 <unk> , who were willing to be willing to dispense these control , which are ready to do with someone else , and i finally <unk> the stories that we don &apos;t ordinarily to tell stories that we don &apos;t ordinarily to tell stories that we don &apos;t ordinarily to tell stories that we don &apos;t ordinarily to tell stories that we don &apos;t ordinarily to
they &apos;re telling us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this movie that you use <unk> to the <unk> of the brain , both <unk> and make movies as well . </s>
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> had been banned . </s>
in the entire city , in the entire city , there hasn &apos;t been a <unk> , no posters , nothing . </s>
and we drove in the urban , in the companies in terms of their way , in america , in america . </s>
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the most feedback or where i was the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things . </s>
and that &apos;s what these things did have done , and this is what these things did . </s>
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the lack of the don &apos;t really have interest in the sense . </s>
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists right . </s>
i &apos;m going to work and do something about other things , something that people think that we &apos;re going to make our different stuff . </s>
and how did that ? what it does ? </s>
now , since the film , the film festival had gone , we can look at this . </s>
the <unk> was the beginning of january , and since then since since then since it , and this is not even the whole thing -- there &apos;s 900 million <unk> of this film . </s>
that &apos;s just one of the time of two one / 7 . </s>
this is just online -- no press , no television . </s>
the film was not too . </s>
there &apos;s not even more online , no <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s not yet in other countries . </s>
now , finally , a very big deal . </s>
and this is not bad for a project where almost every <unk> we were talking about , their customer had to make it happen . </s>
something i &apos;m saying is that if you put your chance , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking about , and that &apos;s the way that we are put in these risks . </s>
i think if you knew people , then you get them closer to failure . </s>
i think that if you raise your employees , risks , you have to avoid the entire company to regain a profit . </s>
i feel that we have to encourage people to take risks . </s>
we need to encourage people to have a fear of opportunity that they might be <unk> . </s>
finally , we should embrace the fear of welcome . </s>
we should put the bear in the cage . </s>
let &apos;s say the fear . they &apos;re the jeopardy . </s>
each one of the big <unk> we &apos;re going to do is to say the risk . </s>
and then , we should embrace transparency . </s>
today , more than ever before , we have a little bit far . </s>
and that &apos;s what i said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; my entire talk &quot; tell them , &quot; my dear friends of <unk> , the $ 50,000 for the rights date for the <unk> at ebay . </s>
big data for organizations around the world in large world . </s>
<unk> &quot; is transparency , &quot; you &apos;re going to meet transparency . &quot; </s>
thank you . </s>
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening right now with the $ $ <unk> ? </s>
this is a great question . </s>
i &apos;ve been an activist with my pocket , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in a <unk> for the next year . </s>
my name is <unk> . </s>
18 months ago , i was doing something other at google , and i &apos;m starting to make a little bit of food and art . my favorite , which is also , and my favorite thing that &apos;s also here today was green light . </s>
and it took 18 months . </s>
a lot of <unk> and stories that i can tell you , with 17 , from nine countries . </s>
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo . </s>
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this . </s>
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and their access to it . </s>
i grew up in india . </s>
i was going to be great training -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had to many of them , and i didn &apos;t have access to many . </s>
when i was traveling , and these museums , to visit these museums , i started learning a lot . </s>
and as i was working for google , i was trying to make this longing -- art to make -- with technology . </s>
we then went to a team , a great cap , and we started with this . </s>
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things since the beginning . </s>
so you just go to <unk> <unk> . </s>
you can imagine in all these museums here . </s>
there &apos;s the <unk> , which was like , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh . </s>
i just come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york . </s>
you get to two ways -- very simple . </s>
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum . </s>
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter . </s>
you go and look at it . </s>
they want to be in the museum ? </s>
open up , they open up , and they &apos;re going to click on . </s>
in the end of the day they want to be the end of the adult . </s>
just goes on . much fun . </s>
by the way . </s>
thank you , but the best thing is going to be . </s>
so i am a gentleman in my <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> . </s>
i see this <unk> . </s>
if the museum gave us the image , she click on it . </s>
this is one of the pictures . </s>
these are all the metadata . </s>
those of you who are really interested in art , can here -- but i &apos;m going to click this . </s>
this is one of the pictures that we &apos;ve learned with the so-called <unk> . </s>
this is the picture for example , about 10 billion <unk> , i think . </s>
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot; </s>
i &apos;m going to show you now , &quot; i &apos;m going to show you this : &quot; </s>
you can actually get very easily and <unk> . </s>
you see something fun here . </s>
i love this guy ; his expression is . </s>
but then they want to really deep to them . </s>
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something that is going on . </s>
and i thought , &quot; wait a moment , this sounds interesting . &quot; </s>
i went up and realized that these kids actually did something . </s>
i was looking for a little bit , with some known , and found out that it &apos;s about a game called <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> on the <unk> of a stick . </s>
it was right popular . </s>
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it . </s>
to go to the first response , you can go to the hook . </s>
only to give you the evidence , i found out what you &apos;re going to see . </s>
and here we were , and this is the painting . </s>
the best part is still -- in a second . </s>
let &apos;s quickly imagine the moma again in new york . </s>
another <unk> of mine , <unk> . </s>
and find it to find out , find out , find out , and find it to find out , find it , and find it to find out , find it , and find it to find out , find it to find detail , and find it to find out , find it to find detail , and find it to find out , find it to find
but what if you want to see the <unk> ? </s>
and what &apos;s only when you see , you want to get this masterpiece to promote this masterpiece ? </s>
you can go into . you can go . </s>
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my research that image until i really am the most famous . </s>
this is <unk> , never before that . </s>
now i &apos;m going to show you my very critical questions . </s>
there &apos;s another time , but i &apos;m missing the time . </s>
this is really cool , it &apos;s called a collections . </s>
everybody &apos;s equal to you , everybody &apos;s going to see if they were a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter . </s>
they can go and make it available to their own museum -- all these pictures can make them all these pictures . </s>
just simply , you go in and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- they can <unk> . </s>
this is the <unk> &apos; bedroom . </s>
they can take everything you can send your friends , and they have a conversation with what you feel when you look at this masterpieces . </s>
i think , finally , is the main thing that all of the other things don &apos;t come here . </s>
they don &apos;t come out of the museums . </s>
that should i mean , maybe . </s>
they &apos;re coming from the artists . </s>
and this was a experience in humility for me . </s>
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to do with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re going to represent the other online . </s>
and the biggest question , the first question , the first question is , &quot; did you make this done to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot; </s>
the answer is no . </s>
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience . </s>
that &apos;s what it goes . thank you . </s>
thank you . </s>
this is a rendering of a brain . your brain can be in two . </s>
this is the left half that the present is , and then the rights half of the rights , the right side is . </s>
if we had a scale , we could have the <unk> of every major person , we could be your brain . </s>
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s completely logically . </s>
this is a person who &apos;s completely intuitive . </s>
well , where would you put your brain on this scale ? </s>
some of us may have underestimated may be in one of these extremes , but i think that for most people in the audience , your brain looks like that -- with a high doses of <unk> , which is at the same time in both of two . </s>
it &apos;s not like they are <unk> or <unk> . </s>
you can be trusted and intuitive . </s>
and so i see as one of the people , collectively , with most other experimental <unk> that have a good logic to add the complex ideas together . </s>
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition in the experiments . </s>
how do we develop these intuition ? well we love to play with things . </s>
so we go out and play and see how it responds . and then we start to develop our intuition . </s>
basically they do the same . </s>
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over the years , it &apos;s probably that a thing to be able to be in a place . </s>
i mean , it may sound very strange to think that this thing at the same time in two different locations , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it . </s>
i remember a kid to see a child playing on a <unk> . </s>
he was a toddler , and he &apos;s not very good at it , and he &apos;s constantly going to do it . </s>
but i bet that it plays with the <unk> of the <unk> , which is that big stuff don &apos;t just come over , and they &apos;re going to be on a location . </s>
and this is great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> . </s>
it would be a <unk> model for a <unk> , because they &apos;re not playing with <unk> , but with these little weird weird particles . </s>
and if you play with your teammates , they &apos;ll find all kinds of weird things -- how they &apos;re going directly through the gate , or they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and so they wrote all these observations on the front , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics . </s>
this was the one of the status of a bunch of years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe it . </s>
but you don &apos;t need to describe them to describe the big one of the big everyday . </s>
that &apos;s what my intuition is not a graphic , and that &apos;s just because i don &apos;t just have to do so much . </s>
well , i &apos;m just going to talk to them , but not very often . </s>
and i &apos;ve never seen it . </s>
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle . </s>
but my own page has not been to be the way . </s>
because if all of these things are made of particles , and all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , not just the rules of the quantum mechanics ? </s>
i don &apos;t see why not that way . </s>
so i would feel better than that , if we could demonstrate that even the rules of the quantum mechanics . </s>
so i made a few years ago that &apos;s exactly what to do . </s>
i got one . </s>
this is the first object that you see , that in the <unk> <unk> . </s>
so what we &apos;re looking at is a tiny computer . </s>
and you can see this green dot there in the middle . </s>
this is the piece metal just going to talk about . </s>
this is a painting . </s>
here , i &apos;ll get something . we &apos;re looking at this center . </s>
and here &apos;s a really big one in this little piece of electronic metal . </s>
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal and it &apos;s about the edge of the edge . </s>
so i made this thing in a computer way that you do a computer chip . </s>
i went to new charge with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the great devices . </s>
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this as a <unk> session , and that thing to get the thing . </s>
this thing has changed the ability to be the ability to be <unk> , but it needs a little help to do it . </s>
look , let me give you a analogy to you . </s>
you know how to be in a crowded test ? </s>
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to be able to do all sorts of weird things , but then they &apos;re going to go other people and i hear all of these things , because i want them to go to her , or frankly , they &apos;re <unk> . </s>
so quantum mechanics , is that the objects are just feeling like this . </s>
the <unk> metallic for <unk> are not just humans , but the light that shine and wind that are over and the wind that &apos;s going to be on them and the heat of the room . </s>
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece metal is <unk> , we had to have the whole <unk> out of <unk> . </s>
and we did this . </s>
we &apos;ve observed the light , put it into a vacuum and <unk> all the air out of the air , and it &apos;s almost all the way to the <unk> , the beginning of metal free was the beginning of metal , it was always like it . </s>
so we measured its movement . </s>
we found that it really strange . </s>
instead of just showing it , it &apos;s just like this , it &apos;s like this . the way it was like <unk> , like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> . </s>
we gave him a little push , we could take it into the same time , and not too hard -- something that &apos;s just in the mechanics . </s>
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is to be fantastic . </s>
what does it mean for a object to vibrate and not to go ? </s>
let &apos;s think about atoms . </s>
so the first case : all the spread of atoms from the piece , there &apos;s a <unk> at all the time , and at the same time , same atoms on the same time . </s>
just too , <unk> votes . </s>
the rest of the time are they <unk> . </s>
the means that every atom at the same time in two different locations , which means that the entire piece is metal to two different places . </s>
i think that &apos;s really cool . </s>
really . </s>
this was what it was worth me for all this year in the solar panels , because , you check that , the <unk> between one single atom and this piece of metal , is about as much as the difference between the play metal and you . </s>
so if you have a single atom at the same time to two different locations , this piece of metal can be metal in two different places , why don &apos;t they do ? </s>
i mean , that &apos;s just what my story is saying . </s>
imagine if you &apos;re at the same time , like the way that they would feel like ? </s>
how would you deal with that your body is in the room , it &apos;s called the room ? </s>
there &apos;s another aspect of history . </s>
when we <unk> it , the light , <unk> and the box , we saw that the piece of metal metal and was always a piece . </s>
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator is actually just diffuse objects that are in a small space that are <unk> in a small space . </s>
you hear a lot of a lot about how quantum mechanics is that everything is connected . </s>
now , this isn &apos;t quite right ; it &apos;s not right . </s>
there &apos;s more than it , it &apos;s still deeper . </s>
it &apos;s so that these connections , their ties to all of these things around them , literally who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of the mechanics . </s>
thank you . </s>
in 2007 , i &apos;ve been a way that we should be <unk> , we should think about economic development . </s>
it should be our goal , that if families think about it , where they live and work , you know , you know , the possibility of one hand , between at least one hand , the one in infrastructure to live in the middle of the brain . </s>
we &apos;re far beyond this goal . </s>
there are billions of people in the developing world , which they would not even have a single city to the disposal that they would say . </s>
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than it costs . </s>
so we could just find the world , perhaps even the hundreds of new cities , <unk> . </s>
now , that may sound the absurd for you , you &apos;ve never thought about new cities . </s>
but they just trade from homes to the forests of the cities . </s>
imagine that half the people who want to live in english , did it already already want to be , but not yet . </s>
they could try to extend the capacity of existing existing existing existing . </s>
but you know , you know what they would sit there , in these homes , and their environment are related to avoid law and their environment . </s>
so it turns out , so it turns out , all of these <unk> . </s>
but you go to a whole new place , a whole new building , the laws of law , there would be a building in this case and not . </s>
i &apos;ve suggested that governments new surfaces create new surfaces that have enough space for a city , and they &apos;ve given them a name : <unk> . </s>
i found out that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of a reform in honduras . </s>
they knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> , the country receives her country to get into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to be able to stay in their country and the same thing . </s>
and paula radcliffe , in this point , <unk> said , &quot; what happens if we <unk> a <unk> , and then we can work on the surface of these messages , which they usually want to go and do anything ? &quot; </s>
in the summer of 2009 , a coral reef . </s>
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a turnaround , both of the spring and <unk> . </s>
he &apos;s going to be <unk> to become his <unk> . </s>
in the meanwhile , i was going to be a talk at tedglobal . </s>
through <unk> , <unk> , and by studying the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the <unk> city to the air elements . </s>
the first thing , the importance of law , laws , the determine that you &apos;re not supposed to be able to do . </s>
we also have to large technologies , but for the progress we need to make technology and laws . and it &apos;s for the usual of law that are going to us . </s>
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala , the <unk> &apos;s dilemma . </s>
the again showed him . </s>
those two guys are remembered me . </s>
&quot; let &apos;s the most part of our country , &quot; &quot; &quot; </s>
so we went in december in the december of a hotels in a hotels . </s>
i tried to make the value of cities , to make how much trouble they are in the costs . </s>
and i &apos;ve been able to use this chart to show how valuable <unk> is at a place like new york , think that one surface in some cases , a <unk> is worth of dollars . </s>
but it was a rather abstract event , where it was a recess , called <unk> said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot; </s>
so the tedtalk ended up in very simple shape , that a <unk> city is a place where the beginning of the law is , a <unk> that is the laws of the laws that we have and the people to decide either of that rules or not . </s>
so i was so fascinated by the president of the <unk> that meant that we need to realize that it &apos;s important , and that this is how to get our country into the country . </s>
i was asked to go to <unk> and <unk> to keep a lecture talk to you . </s>
so i brought a <unk> with facts that a graph like this involves that involves that involves that , it has to try to illustrate that if you want to make a lot of a score , it &apos;s a very big city . </s>
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport , which was built in <unk> . </s>
they had a <unk> of 100 <unk> . </s>
so i tried to convince you if you want to build a new city , you have to start to build a residential area of at least 1,000 . </s>
this is more than 250 thousand tomorrow . </s>
fish have all the <unk> . </s>
the faces of the audience were very seriously and attention . </s>
the head of the world came to the stage , and i said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you for your talk , but could we see the tedtalk . </s>
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot; </s>
i &apos;ve been <unk> , and they looked at the tedtalk . </s>
and i came to the <unk> , that a new city has new possibilities for the people . </s>
there was the ability to live in honduras , rather than from kilometers north , rather than from kilometers away from miles away . </s>
and a new city includes new ways to leaders with a group . </s>
the leaders of government in the fiction would be based on the help of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could benefit from their laws to the laws of law for these charter and the expected of the <unk> , that everyone can trust that the charter is really becoming being manipulated . </s>
and the insight of president <unk> , was that the fact that the research of the research of the research has been as a way to bring the top investors for all parties and the city for many parties in honduras , who had been under fear and mistrust . </s>
we &apos;re in a field , we &apos;re in a field . </s>
this is from this place . </s>
it &apos;s a <unk> thousand square miles . </s>
and shortly after that , january of january , they have been working on the change of the constitution , to have a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> for special <unk> . </s>
in a country , which has just been a whole crisis behind it was taken in congress in the congress for this <unk> to the voice . </s>
all parties , the <unk> of society , the <unk> of society . </s>
to be part of the constitution , it has to be the twice by congress . </s>
february 17th february was going to be a voice of the <unk> to a voice . </s>
directly , in the 21st , between the 21st and the final , in february , a delegation of roughly 30 percent lines of the world that were really interested in the business of the <unk> . </s>
one place is south korea . </s>
this is a picture of a big , new core , which was <unk> in south <unk> , in south <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> . </s>
all you can see on this image , was built within four years , after spending four years after it took four years after it took off . </s>
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is . </s>
there were two towns in china , and the third one is in preparation . </s>
so if you saw virtually this , it &apos;s where we stand today . </s>
they &apos;ve got a <unk> ; and they &apos;re already doing this area for the second city . </s>
it &apos;s already been working on a very smart , that <unk> whales are going to be allowed , and it &apos;s also working on a very same amount of work . </s>
a country has already offered his own supreme court at the <unk> depths of the <unk> appeal of the <unk> . </s>
and also curated and <unk> are very interested . </s>
they even funding for funding . </s>
one thing , as you know , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . </s>
there are many times they would like to be in america , particularly in a place with a <unk> , and there are lots of people who would like to live . </s>
all over the world , 700 million people who are living , they &apos;d like to live in a different place . </s>
a million people are abandoned , and they put back in the united states . </s>
many of you are <unk> , who are forced to be more , their families , their families are going to be working at risk sometimes , it &apos;s <unk> to eat food and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes and clothes . </s>
unfortunately , sometimes they &apos;re even kids who trying to find their parents again , which they &apos;re in some cases , and hadn &apos;t seen more recently for a decade . </s>
so what &apos;s it for a idea of thinking about this is a whole new city ? </s>
or even more or even more , in these cities , or hundreds of all over the world ? </s>
so what &apos;s it for a idea of trying to get any family between the united states , which is a choice between the united states ? </s>
this is an idea that &apos;s worth caring to spread . </s>
my friends from honduras asked me to say thank ted . </s>
you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ? </s>
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ? </s>
i &apos;ve made a survey with 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions that are <unk> a typical american miles of decisions , a typical american person is <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , is <unk> <unk> . </s>
and also recently , recently made a study in which they were doing a week . </s>
and this scientist , they simply have the different themes that they &apos;re concerned about , and how much time they make a lot of decisions that are <unk> with the issues . </s>
and they found that a <unk> of the week is busy in the week . </s>
each of these issues , of course , many decisions , many decisions . </s>
fifty percent of their decisions were within nine or less . </s>
just for about 12 percent of your decisions you have an hour or more than a hour or more . </s>
think about their own decisions . </s>
you know how many decisions you have in the nine minutes of the world &apos;s office in an hour ? </s>
how do you think it &apos;s the decisions to overcome the decisions ? </s>
today i want to talk about one of our modern era of our modern time , the <unk> . </s>
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions . </s>
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers . </s>
if i ask you a question , i &apos;ll raise you , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , just the hand , if you want to burn a few calories . </s>
and i couldn &apos;t , please , please , i urge you a question , and your answer , is , so my first question for today : are you ready to hear something about listening to hear ? </s>
thank you . </s>
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i was going to get to this very empty , at least at the time , he was really exclusive . </s>
it was a shop who &apos;s <unk> . </s>
this business , it was almost like a <unk> . </s>
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and they and <unk> different kinds of vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of fruit and vegetables and vegetables , when we actually have been <unk> . </s>
i &apos;ve loved it to this business , but i &apos;ve asked , well , you know , how does it matter that you &apos;ve never got to do anything ? </s>
here &apos;s the olive oil spill . </s>
they had about 75 different olive oil , including which ones who were in a boxes , who were caught by thousands of thousand years . </s>
so i decided to visit one day , and i asked the leader , &quot; works , &quot; works this model , that you &apos;re making all these choices are really all these choices . </s>
and he showed up the <unk> of tourists that would have been given day and they would expect their cameras . </s>
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose to our experiment for our experiment . </s>
here &apos;s your <unk> . </s>
they had <unk> different types of <unk> . </s>
we have a little <unk> right right on the entrance of the <unk> . </s>
we have six different flavors of <unk> , and we &apos;ve got two things : one , i &apos;m going to be what , i &apos;ll be really , as well , i &apos;ll try to stand more people , and more <unk> ? </s>
there are more people stand up when it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent . </s>
and then we saw that , we saw what people were more likely to put a glass of glass . </s>
now we saw the classroom . </s>
the people who were stayed when it was 24 , only three percent actually led a glass of glass . </s>
people who are stayed when it was six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of glass . </s>
now , if you calculate it , bought the people six times a glass of glass , who they had six , when they were 24 to the people 24 24 . </s>
now , not to buy glass , not glass to buy a glass of <unk> , is good for us -- but it turns out that the <unk> is also good decisions in a very strongly decision . </s>
we don &apos;t decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests . </s>
so the issue of the day , people save . </s>
i &apos;m going to describe you a study that i &apos;m with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we &apos;re teaching the decisions to <unk> for retirement , for the retirement of the retirement of almost a million americans in the entire united states . </s>
and what we did was whether the number of the <unk> that had been a <unk> possible to plan plan to determine whether more tomorrow for tomorrow . </s>
and we found that there was one correlation . </s>
so in these plans , we had about the people who had gotten a lot of the people between two to a decade ago . </s>
and what we found was that the more were the more challenging people were offered that , in fact , the motor rate was . </s>
if you look at the extremes , the plans that you had two degrees , had a <unk> in the world -- not as high as we want it . </s>
in the plans , almost 60 degrees , the <unk> now was going to be on about the <unk> <unk> . </s>
now , even if they were <unk> , when they were concerned about the choices , even , negative consequences . </s>
so the people who decided to participate in the more ways you were going to provide the more choices to the disposal , the more they would improvise and <unk> . </s>
the more ways they were standing , the more more they put their entire money into pure <unk> . </s>
no one of these extreme decisions , just to make the decisions that someone would recommend if you were supposed to recommend their future self , if you were important to the future of your well-being . </s>
well , in the past 10 years , we &apos;ve three <unk> negative consequences that can offer that make us that flow from more and more choices . </s>
it &apos;s going to make the choice -- they &apos;re going to be <unk> , even if it &apos;s your own authentic interest . </s>
they make more decisions -- more financial decisions , and they &apos;re getting more useful . </s>
they choose to find more things that they can make less content , even if you make objective better . </s>
the main reason that we might be very passionate about this great conspiracy , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we don &apos;t know the comparison and <unk> and the limiting , and then something that &apos;s going to be some of the amazing intervention . </s>
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have in different ways and different kinds of sources -- they just can use their hands . </s>
the first thing is . </s>
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true true than today that less is more . </s>
people are always worried if i say , &quot; it &apos;s going to be . &quot; </s>
they always do it to be <unk> . </s>
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to go to the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> are going to be going , you have the costs down , it &apos;s going to be the cost of the star , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement of the <unk> . </s>
and as a cross-country skier and the <unk> of the different towers of 26 and <unk> species of 26 on 15 dollars , they have a rise of the increase 10 percent . </s>
when the golden <unk> corporation took her 10 , they &apos;ve sold the worst <unk> <unk> , they &apos;ve been able to have the revenues to the 87 of 87 about 87 -- a result of the year of the sales and the reduction of the year . </s>
you know , the average <unk> of the <unk> , provide them to look at the products . </s>
the typical wal-mart provide them now is 100,000 products . </s>
but the <unk> supermarket , the <unk> &apos;s called the world is <unk> , and they offer them to have 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in the doses of doses . </s>
now in the world of the <unk> , i think one of the best examples that have recently been on the market , about how you get the choices , and what about david <unk> has been highly heavily <unk> , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered to harvard . </s>
every single child employees takes automatically in a <unk> part . </s>
the ones that really want to make a choice , 20 fund , 20 years ago , not 300 or more . </s>
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i could it . </s>
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot; </s>
and the first thing i ask the staff is , &quot; tell me how the capacities are different from each other . </s>
and if your employees cannot get <unk> , it can &apos;t affect their customers . &quot; </s>
well before we started having a <unk> , i had a conversation with a <unk> . </s>
and the thing is that he would be ready to be ready to tell everybody in this audience in the audience , the earth &apos;s most beautiful to the earth in the world . </s>
there &apos;s a description of the road . </s>
and i want to read you . </s>
and now i give you a few seconds to read them and then i urge you to clap when they &apos;re willing to be willing to be willing to cover it . </s>
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to assume , is it going to be <unk> . </s>
are all the time ? </s>
well , let me show you something more about it . </s>
they knew it was a trick , right ? </s>
now , who is ready for this journey . </s>
i think i &apos;ve got more hands . </s>
all right . </s>
and the fact is that she &apos;s looking at the first time , when the first time , when the second time , but i would take it to guess they &apos;re going to absorb it on the second time . </s>
because the pictures makes it for you . </s>
what makes me to do with the second technology that you &apos;re helping to deal with the problem of the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between the capacity to understand what consequences are associated with the individual ways , and that will be based on the individual choices and you have to be thrown in . </s>
why do people spend about 15 to 30 percent more if you use a <unk> or a <unk> , than in the heart of the day ? </s>
because it &apos;s not us to be a <unk> . </s>
and it turns out , if you get it to you that something feels like , it &apos;s a very good tool that you &apos;re going to save more . </s>
so we &apos;ve been in a study that i &apos;ve been doing with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve made a study with people in <unk> -- and these people were <unk> , we &apos;ve been doing their participation for their <unk> . </s>
and as this gathering , we have these judgments , as it always was , just like it was , we have a little bit more added . </s>
the power we have to <unk> , was that we asked the people asked to think of all positive things that would save in their lives , if you save money . </s>
so in the case , we had this simple thing , there was one of the people in the front of people who were willing to save or a decade of the number of people who were willing to save or a decade of four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for the <unk> . </s>
the third technology : <unk> . </s>
we can better deal with more than more choices . </s>
so for instance , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> . </s>
it turns out that there are in the <unk> black-and-white at the top , and down in the northeast area , the number of <unk> different species of magazines to <unk> different species of magazines to <unk> different species of magazines to <unk> . </s>
but you know what ? </s>
if i &apos;m 600 to you 600 , and they show you 10 categories or i show you 10 , or i show you 400 magazines , and they would have a better <unk> , when i had given you to have the 400 of the time i had given them to 600 . </s>
because the most favorite thing i can hold it apart . </s>
here are two different types of things . </s>
one is called &quot; <unk> &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
if you think that the left is ad is <unk> , and the ad is the right right , they will be in the hands . </s>
okay , there &apos;s a few . </s>
if you think that the right side is , and the ones on the right side is <unk> , then they may please . </s>
okay , a few more . </s>
well , it turns out they &apos;re right . </s>
the thing on the left is the jazz and the right on the right is <unk> , but you know what ? </s>
this is an awful <unk> <unk> . </s>
the most difficult need to say something that &apos;s the opportunity to be the opportunity . </s>
and this problem you see , if you look at the long lists all of this <unk> all of these dishes . </s>
who are really going to be able to do it ? </s>
my fourth technology : for complexity . </s>
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we need to use them . </s>
we have to increase the complexity of slowly . </s>
i &apos;ll give you an example of what i mean . </s>
let &apos;s a very , very complicated choice : the purchase of a car . </s>
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car . </s>
you have to design different decisions to design the car . </s>
now , these decisions in the number of choices that they offer a choice . </s>
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i &apos;ve been 56 . </s>
engines , four possibilities . </s>
what i &apos;m doing is , i change the order of the decisions . </s>
half of the customer is going to be supported by many ways to 56 <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
the other half of the customer is about the low ways , four gears , to the 56 of the 56 , many ways . </s>
what &apos;s going on ? </s>
how do they are . </s>
if you constantly all constantly the <unk> of choice , they &apos;re going to be overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m sorry . </s>
what you find is that the people who are the low <unk> , and they &apos;re always going to vote the <unk> . </s>
we lose them . </s>
go from the little choice , then they &apos;re going to stay on . </s>
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same amount of possibilities . </s>
the only thing i did , is the order of transforming the order of view the order of view . </s>
if i start with the simple thing , i learn like i &apos;m <unk> . </s>
even though the gears , i didn &apos;t say anything about my preferences at the point is still says , it &apos;s always going to happen to see me . </s>
it also tastes me in excitement about the great product i &apos;m going to be <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to be willing to be interested in me to be interested in me . </s>
let me wrap up . </s>
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of the <unk> is supposed to be -- they &apos;re going to make the <unk> alternatives ; it &apos;s <unk> -- we can make it more categories , fewer <unk> , fewer <unk> ; it &apos;s not going to complexity . </s>
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe today is to try to manage the opportunity to manage the opportunity -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , for people who are being available . </s>
because i think the key to best is best possible , that you &apos;re going to be in the selection . </s>
and the more we are going to be on the solution , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice . </s>
thank you . </s>
hi . i &apos;m a big <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i think of <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s true . </s>
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then we &apos;re going to make sure why it &apos;s important . </s>
we all want to be optimistic , <unk> , <unk> , and i was young , that &apos;s so infinitely difficult to do . </s>
but <unk> , we have all of them or all our creative activities are capable of <unk> in a part of the culture of our world . </s>
each one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday . </s>
but at youtube , more than 48 hours a minute , a minute . </s>
again , just a tiny percentage of <unk> and will have thousands of times and so on the cultural moment . </s>
how does this work ? </s>
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected . </s>
so , then we want to be . </s>
oh my god . oh my god . </s>

if you know , these other peaks are also <unk> . </s>
but what &apos;s happening with this day , this particular friday ? </s>
well , <unk> <unk> , lots of blogs on this , to write about it . </s>
michael science science was <unk> theater , one of the first ones that was a first that joke . </s>
so , is that a individual or a group of <unk> has a <unk> , with a big audience and so that it &apos;s sped up . </s>
then , these community of people who shared this big <unk> of <unk> , and i started talking about it and to make it . </s>
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of <unk> . </s>
there &apos;s already been a parody for every single day , it was an 18-month day . </s>
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the power of our path is going to be part of this phenomenon -- either by putting it spread , either , we &apos;re going to do something new emerges . </s>
&quot; <unk> <unk> is <unk> and music in <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s it , just . </s>

there were no . </s>
somebody made an amazing version of it . </s>
and then it became international . </s>
and a total <unk> fired in the ground that it &apos;s dependent upon a stupid joke , that we all participate in . </s>
today , we don &apos;t find anything we do with . </s>
who would have been to do anything ? </s>
who would have been called &quot; <unk> black or rebecca or &quot; <unk> <unk> . </s>
what thought-controlled can do you can write in these things like ? </s>
in a world where every minute of two video is going to take video , only really unique and unexpected <unk> like the video . </s>
i was not interested in my friend , when a friend told me , i gave me this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against drug . </s>
i got a ticket because i don &apos;t get on the <unk> , but often there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> on the highway of the highway . </s>
and that &apos;s completely surprising and humorous was , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and his argument for five million time . </s>
this approach is true for anything new , which we do creative . </s>
and this is a big question , in a big question ... </s>
what does that mean ? </s>
<unk> . </s>
what does that mean ? </s>
<unk> , creative <unk> , totally unexpected , are the properties of a new kind of media and culture that has access to the audience and in the audience . </s>
as i said , one of the most biggest star -- justin bieber -- graduated his beginnings at youtube . </s>
no one has to give you green light . </s>
and today we &apos;re all going to be as a result of our popular popular . </s>
and these are not the properties of the old media and they &apos;re making it , hardly the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future . </s>
thank you . </s>
how can i talk about three generations , and how the astonishing intensity of this connectedness in a <unk> girl , when she appeared in life for about 30 years , and never disappeared in life for a four-year-old girl , than they were sitting in the lives of a <unk> , a <unk> , which is now in san francisco , and never gave a little bit of a

i never met him . </s>
but our life are so much more than our memory . </s>
my grandmother has never forget his life . </s>
i had to worry about that it wasn &apos;t been for free , and it was my job , to learn that the story was trying to crush us to <unk> ourselves , we were doing it . </s>
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> silent silent silent silent . </s>
my mom may be 18 , when her father died -- i was in a <unk> marriage , a <unk> marriage , has been with two little girls . </s>
for her , this was her one task : the new escape and a new life in australia . </s>

after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat to the lake , as a <unk> . </s>
all the adults were aware of the risks . </s>
the biggest fear they had to do with death and death . </s>
as most adults , they had a little <unk> in the boat , a little baby dish . </s>
at a <unk> , i was just going to have my sister and i was taking them and i was able to drink my grandmother . </s>
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the engine , which starts a <unk> wave on the bug , the wake up and empty portraits . </s>
i remember not to be able to get the number of times , but they turned out of the men on our boat , or at the <unk> of the engine , the <unk> of six hours . </s>
but i remember the lights in front of the <unk> coast , and to the young man , the collapsed and died , the end of the first <unk> , the end of the first <unk> , the mine of the men on the platform . </s>
no apple has ever been so upset . </s>
after three months in a refugee camp . </s>
and the next phase of four women are in three generations that are going to build a new life . </s>
we were in <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the population of <unk> . </s>
in other words , whose existence were completely unknown , there was no <unk> in <unk> . </s>
the energy from the rest of the world , the energy from the rest of the world . </s>
and the <unk> <unk> were brought together between people who had one thing : they started to <unk> . </s>
my mom worked on farms , then on a assembly line , six days , double double double <unk> . </s>
it took her time to find english and <unk> . </s>
we were poor . </s>
everybody was accepted and resolved in other education for english and mathematics , no , we had to get to vote . </s>
two of the <unk> for school , each one , to show the holes in the other . </s>
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to date six years . </s>
and there were the rare , devastating <unk> of <unk> , &quot; and here and <unk> , &quot; well , go home . &quot; </s>
home , where you go home ? </s>
something more adventurous is going to me . </s>
there was a <unk> and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot; </s>
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed . </s>
my mom was every night , but we were each other and the movements of our grandmother &apos;s house in the house . </s>
my mom suffered from the boat . </s>
and it was my job , every night would come to stay down to their <unk> , so i could <unk> it . </s>
she came up a <unk> , then a <unk> and a business one , and she &apos;s a business . </s>
and women came with their stories about men who are not <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and <unk> kids , trapped between two worlds . </s>
loans became <unk> . </s>
and went to <unk> . </s>
i was living in <unk> . </s>
in one , i was the classic director , the <unk> <unk> of himself . </s>
in the other hand , i was living in black life , the tragic scar of violence , the <unk> and the insulation . </s>
but that &apos;s how many of the years . </s>
and because of this help i was in my last year of the <unk> as a boy <unk> of the year . </s>
and i was chased by a <unk> to the next , and the edges of the time . </s>
tan le <unk> <unk> , the rest of <unk> , was the <unk> le , and the <unk> activist that led to the places that they had heard of them , and in a row , they could never have imagined them . </s>
i was not familiar with the <unk> . </s>
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> . </s>
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine . </s>
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything . </s>
i wanted to go into the routine and the early part of the life of a car -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters that every daughters that every single daughters , by connecting each other as <unk> as a time , and we &apos;ve been in bed , we still have three . </s>
i was told my mom , i wouldn &apos;t be able to do this . </s>
and she remembered that i was going to be so old as she was at the time when we had the boat . </s>
no one was never been a chance . </s>
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot; </s>
so i spoke about <unk> and training , and the <unk> are the <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and the more open i was talking about , the more i should tell . </s>
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of you did what they loved to action , lived on the limits of the bounds . </s>
and even though i had my degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t make me with a career in a career . </s>
there was to be another other <unk> . </s>
and i realized the same time , it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , a <unk> , new -- and not only , but something that you must be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> . </s>
because <unk> can be easily to collapse , to the collapse of the horizons , so easily can mean that you &apos;re going to do the assumptions of the surroundings . </s>
i &apos;m enough to know that , yes , the world , but not as if you were <unk> it . </s>
opportunities , they weren &apos;t allowed to be , were encouraged . </s>
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> . </s>
so i followed my gut . </s>
i collected a little team of people to <unk> me , for the <unk> , &quot; don &apos;t go to a <unk> challenge . </s>
we didn &apos;t have a dime . </s>
at the end of a day , i saw a huge of the <unk> that we shared with . </s>
we were working on to the night . </s>
so most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we were filled the breakthrough . </s>
i was helping the choice , to pull them , and the united states , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , too , in the united states , too , too , too , too , too , too ,
after just a journey . </s>
my heart . </s>
three months later , i was going to be shy and the adventure went on . </s>
before i want to talk about the lecture , i want to tell you about my grandmother . </s>
it grew up at a time in the <unk> , the social norm and the local <unk> that was the most important person . </s>
life didn &apos;t changed for centuries . </s>
her father died of birth . </s>
her mom moved on . </s>
with 17 , she &apos;s going to be the second woman of a foot , which was her mother . </s>
without support , she used to be picked up for a <unk> , by putting it in front of trial and <unk> in her own case , and a larger <unk> , when she &apos;s won . </s>
&quot; don &apos;t go to be a rock . </s>
i just fished in sydney , when she died , 1000 miles away from the road . </s>
i looked through the <unk> and saw on the other side . </s>
i knew she was to be able to get to <unk> . </s>
my mom was just a few minutes after that . </s>
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and her <unk> . </s>
we were told her stories and <unk> her , we were in her . </s>
and then midnight was the monk , and he said , he &apos;s going to end the damn things . </s>
my mom asked us to be wise . </s>
it asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot; </s>
&quot; because she said it has been , &quot; he said . </s>
&quot; you haven &apos;t <unk> . &quot; </s>
if there is a tape , then it &apos;s going to be connected by the women . </s>
you see who we were and how life we &apos;ve been shaped , we can now see that the men that might be in our lives , we &apos;ve been going to be in our lives . </s>
and so defeat would be too easy . </s>
now i would like to have my own children , and i think it &apos;s about the boat . </s>
who would ever wish ? </s>
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave <unk> of the engine , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the engine , the most of the engine , who don &apos;t guarantee anything ? </s>
i don &apos;t know . </s>
but if i could give this , and they would definitely do it , i would do it . </s>
and also , is <unk> <unk> , here in the fourth , in the fourth , you know . </s>
i &apos;m here to share my photography , you know , i &apos;m here to share my photography . </s>
is it all the way you have ? </s>
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t move to your camera . </s>
but i started my interest in photography when i was writing about 15 years old , at age 15 years . </s>
i was drawing with my earlier predilection for me , but it was a little different , because the <unk> was the process of the process of the process . </s>
and if you &apos;re a picture with a camera , the process , the process , if you &apos;ve been on the door . </s>
for me , i seemed to be able to get to the right place at the right time . </s>
i thought everybody could do this . </s>
so i wanted to do something else , something that starts to start when the trigger the trigger is going to work on . </s>
photos like this : a lot of a much more <unk> road . </s>
but it &apos;s got a unexpected twist . </s>
and <unk> still is a realistic plane . </s>
or pictures like this -- dark and <unk> , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but all of the apes , but
if i say i mean , i mean . </s>
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you really can really capture , but i want to make it look like this , on a photograph . </s>
photos where you have to think about a very brief moment , to find the trick . </s>
so it &apos;s more about an idea that when it really makes a moment . </s>
what &apos;s the trick that &apos;s going to be realistic looking like ? </s>
or the colors , and the colors ? </s>
it &apos;s about the light ? </s>
what creates the illusion ? </s>
sometimes the perspective that &apos;s illusion . </s>
but ultimately , but it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can get on a two-dimensional surface . </s>
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we &apos;re keeping for realistic . </s>
so i think the essentials are very simple . </s>
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and lets it to create a alternative reality . </s>
and let me give you an easy example . </s>
we &apos;ve taken three of physical objects that we all identify with each other to identify in a three-dimensional world . </s>
but in a certain way , you can teach something that would still be <unk> , as if it could exist . </s>
but we know we know that this is not possible . </s>
so we &apos;re not our brains , because our brains don &apos;t really just embraced the way that it doesn &apos;t really make sense . </s>
and i see the same process of photography . </s>
it &apos;s really just about different realities . </s>
so the things that look like a view of realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about things around us . </s>
if we &apos;re taking pictures , it really matters to think , because otherwise they just look wrong . </s>
so i would say that there are three basic rules to get a <unk> result . </s>
as you can see , there are no three of the pictures . </s>
and you can make them a little bit of a special issue . </s>
so the first rule is , is that the west took the same perspective . </s>
secondly , they should have the same <unk> . </s>
and these two pictures of these two different parts -- from the same height , and the same <unk> . </s>
third , it &apos;s impossible to make it impossible to be different , where the individual pictures begin and end by connecting them into it . </s>
do it impossible to say that photo was actually turned out . </s>
by looking at color , contrast and contrast to the edges of the day , the individual pictures , <unk> , <unk> , and disorders , we &apos;ll leave the borders between the different images , and let &apos;s see a single picture , even though a picture of levels of levels . </s>
here &apos;s another example . </s>
you may think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom line is manipulated . </s>
this image is , from the photos of different locations . </s>
i personally have easier to create a place to create a place to find a place , because you don &apos;t need to deal with ideas in its head . </s>
but it &apos;s a lot of planning . </s>
and when i was in the winter , i knew i had to take a lot of months to find them to find the different places that are going to take place for the pieces of the puzzle . </s>
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> . </s>
the shore is from a different place . </s>
the <unk> comes from a census . </s>
and yeah , i &apos;ve even got the base up on the island of red <unk> to look <unk> . </s>
to get a <unk> situation , it &apos;s pouring out of me , so you know , it &apos;s pouring out of that . </s>
i &apos;m always beginning to a <unk> , an idea . </s>
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of the different pictures . </s>
and here &apos;s a little bit of a very good job . </s>
and then when you do good , it can be pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s also a realistic . </s>
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited , is our imagination . </s>
thank you . </s>
i would like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> . </s>
and i think that the important point is that we stopped talking to our patients . </s>
and one of the things that we introduced to the <unk> was , a <unk> . </s>
and yet , they &apos;re not particularly scientifically -- you &apos;ll imagine a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how are you going ? </s>
how can we help you ? &quot; </s>
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the time -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> , because we stopped listening to the <unk> . </s>
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing . </s>
she has a button , you know . </s>
and every morning i got to it . </s>
and yeah , i have a problem , as you see . </s>
i &apos;ve come to 95 , you know , 95 . </s>
it works just simple : every time i &apos;m going to the <unk> , you sends my data , you &apos;re sending my data . </s>
and there &apos;s also a bit of my <unk> <unk> , so that he can see where my favorite is , and that &apos;s not just in the moment i need to be in the moment , but also with a glimpse of the past . </s>
there &apos;s something else . </s>
maybe you know , i &apos;ve got a <unk> on twitter <unk> on twitter . </s>
so i started to watch every morning i &apos;m going to talk about my <unk> and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch , only one of the lunch would only have a little salad . &quot; </s>
but this is the most obvious thing that &apos;s going to happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients because that could be used to obesity , or it could patients become obesity or it could affect the smoking . </s>
but it could also be used to people from their own communities , and they &apos;re trying to play together to play their health . </s>
and then , starting to start a lot of the market . </s>
it &apos;s going to give you a little bit of <unk> , you can put a iphone or something like this . </s>
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure from home , from home to measuring your blood pressure , to send him on their doctor , and it &apos;s a little more than 100 dollars . </s>
at this point , the patient &apos;s game comes into play , and they can &apos;t just go back to the control , captain on their own boat , but also the way we &apos;re going to be able to help us , and the most part of the healthcare , ocean demand , and so on . </s>
they &apos;re doing things that are easy to be easy and start to hug the patient in the team . </s>
and they can reach through these things , but also by tactile . </s>
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you a short video . </s>
we all have the <unk> in our cars . </s>
maybe even in our senior phones . </s>
we know precisely exactly where all the women around the world around <unk> . </s>
we know one where all of the stations are . </s>
and yeah , we can find out . </s>
but where would be the next olympics to help this patient ? </s>
we &apos;ve got <unk> , and no one knew it . </s>
no one knew where the next previous school district in this moment was . </s>
so , what did we ? we &apos;ve done <unk> in the netherlands . </s>
we have a website and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please , you share where it &apos;s <unk> , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s picking up <unk> , of course . </s>
and over 10,000 <unk> , they &apos;ve already been on the netherlands . </s>
the next step was to find the apps of the apps . </s>
and we have a solar system . </s>
we have developed a app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> . </s>
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and somebody &apos;s down , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , to find your neighbor to find the next <unk> that can save the next <unk> . </s>
and then we want to just do this as a <unk> , like the product , but as a <unk> , it &apos;s also as a <unk> . </s>
and we want to bring this to a global scale . </s>
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from others to help us understand how <unk> to behave , to help us understand the world &apos;s rights to crowdsource the world &apos;s own world around the world . </s>
and if you &apos;re in a holiday , you know , it &apos;s your own or anyone else , you can find a <unk> . </s>
the other thing we want to ask is that companies are all around the world in the power of these <unk> . </s>
these may be <unk> , or for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still on its location . </s>
please help us and try to improve the health of the health , but it &apos;s going to be the hands . </s>
thank you . </s>
i &apos;m going to report , i &apos;m going to report . </s>
i &apos;m working on the <unk> . </s>
and my little <unk> , i want to force us to the world by making it to be ... </s>
it &apos;s like , it &apos;s called the <unk> . </s>
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do . </s>
oh , a moment . </s>
it &apos;s probably going to be a load . </s>
well , we can just pick this -- i &apos;m going to just put the video -- i &apos;m going to skip the video ... </s>
no . </s>
this is not -- ... </s>
okay . </s>
<unk> is ... &quot; ... </s>
oh , my time is already right ? </s>
okay . thank you . </s>
so a few years ago , i took a program to get the stars in technology and design to get a year , and in a environment , which is pretty much everything they hate , we have them work in the government . </s>
the program is called &quot; code &apos;s america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> of space . </s>
we choose to work every year , and we &apos;re letting them work with <unk> . </s>
instead of throwing into the third world , we send them into <unk> . </s>
and there they evolved great applications , working with urban employees . </s>
but what they really do is to show is to show what is possible today . </s>
so they make al jazeera . </s>
al is a <unk> in the city of boston . </s>
here it looks like if he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks is somebody who &apos;s really looking at it , because he knows , he &apos;s not very much in the <unk> when he &apos;s <unk> from a meter of feet . </s>
how did these particular kind of search for help ? </s>
we had a team of a team of a bunch of petrol in boston , &quot; program . </s>
they were there in february , and it &apos;s got the february of february <unk> . </s>
and they realized that city never is free . </s>
but a particular fellow named <unk> , which was a man named erik <unk> , which was another thing and that was that the residents are the <unk> of the <unk> , right before . </s>
so he did what every good thing i would do , he wrote a app . </s>
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant . </s>
you seem to be free to him free , when it &apos;s supposed to be . </s>
if you do the <unk> , you can give you an embarrassment , and he called the first al gore . </s>
if you don &apos;t do that , you can &apos;t get it up . </s>
so there &apos;s a nice little place . </s>
this is a little bit of little app . </s>
it &apos;s probably the minimal of the 21 times that are played over the last year . </s>
but they do something about what no other <unk> . </s>
they &apos;re going to be evolving . </s>
there &apos;s this fellow in the <unk> division of the city , the <unk> , who seen that he could use these app , but it could <unk> the citizens of <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but they steal the batteries . </s>
so he got the citizen to check them . </s>
and then decided to use the app , to get the citizen to get the <unk> <unk> . </s>
and chicago she did urge them to get the <unk> <unk> , when it &apos;s been a way . </s>
we know nine cities that are planning to use these app . </s>
and she has been successful , organic , natural , natural . </s>
if you know something about you , you know , that &apos;s not that way . </s>
the <unk> of software takes a few years . </s>
we had a team that was working on a project that was working on a project for three people . </s>
it was about a method to figure out what the right symbiotic schools are in their children . </s>
and what was going later , when it was going to be about the normal channels , it would have been taken over two million dollars , and it would have been worth over two million dollars . </s>
and this is not anything . </s>
there &apos;s a project in the added of the california , which is the revenue of the taxpayer in two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
and there are projects like this to the government of government . </s>
so one app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then from <unk> , is a kind of shot in front of the <unk> of the institution . </s>
it shows how government work better -- not as a different company , how many people think they should be . </s>
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself . </s>
and that means free to be access , which means open and productive . </s>
and that &apos;s important . </s>
but more importantly , that they &apos;re a new generation that &apos;s the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective purpose . </s>
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good at the very good module of digital technology . </s>
now there &apos;s a big community of people that we need to do things that we need to be in common . </s>
it &apos;s not just a &quot; code &apos;s america &apos;s life , there are hundreds of people in the country , and they can write a day in their own communities . </s>
they didn &apos;t call the government . </s>
they &apos;re so happy to her , but she &apos;s not paying yourself , they fix it . </s>
and these people know something that we lost in the eyes . </s>
and this is when you all your feelings above politics and the snake and the snake and all the other things that we really have really upset , is government in the core words &apos; , &quot; what we do not do alone . &quot; </s>
today , a lot of people who moved the government . </s>
and if you &apos;re a reason to people , i urge you that you &apos;re doing about it , because things are changing . </s>
politics don &apos;t change ; government is in the change . </s>
and because the government finally ended up its power from us -- <unk> : &quot; we &apos;ve got the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change is happening . </s>
i didn &apos;t know much about government than i started this program . </s>
and as many people , i thought that it was mainly about the government mainly to vote in a office . </s>
now after years , i &apos;m going to be the following that it &apos;s mostly in the end of the time , to go back . </s>
this is the call for service and information . </s>
there &apos;s usually a flood out when you <unk> in your town . </s>
if you ever have to have the opportunity to have a chance to work in your <unk> , as our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , the people who are struggling to have the government because of many different problems , including that one <unk> in your house . </s>
scott , the <unk> . </s>
he calls &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database . </s>
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s beginning to do with the <unk> . </s>
and then he says , &quot; look , you can just put all the doors in your home and very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot; </s>
and this worked . round for scott . </s>
but that was not the end of the <unk> . </s>
in boston , not just a call . </s>
it &apos;s got a app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
we didn &apos;t have those app . </s>
this is the work of the new urban <unk> in the office of the new york city in boston . </s>
one day -- this is an actual book -- came to : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> , not say whether it &apos;s dead . </s>
how do i get them ? &quot; </s>
but what &apos;s happening with &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; </s>
scott , scott of the human being , of human being . </s>
but on the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s all of the things that everybody can see it . </s>
and in this case , it appeared a neighbor . </s>
and the next entry we received , &quot; i went there , &quot; i went there , i went to the <unk> behind the house . </s>
<unk> ? yeah ? <unk> . </s>
then the <unk> is the page . went home . </s>
good night , sweet . &quot; </s>
pretty simple . </s>
this is great . here &apos;s the digital box . </s>
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government in the crowdsourcing is to get . </s>
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform . </s>
and i mean , not necessarily one of the definition of the platform . </s>
i &apos;m also rather talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others . </s>
a citizen adds another citizen , but the government played a central role . </s>
they were able to do these two people . </s>
and you could connect to bed nets , if you were , but a neighbor &apos;s a neighbor &apos;s better health services and confined services . </s>
if a neighbor &apos;s neighbor , we &apos;re using our communities . </s>
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money . </s>
one of the most important things is that we have to think about it is that government doesn &apos;t the same thing . </s>
and most people understand what they believe is that one is the input of the other . </s>
that our contribution to the system is . </s>
how many times we have a political leaders -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re rejecting ourselves and we &apos;re rejecting that government , and our needs is , and then we &apos;re rejecting ourselves , and then our needs it &apos;s hard . </s>
this is because the government of the government is ocean and politics that are the supreme court . </s>
and what &apos;s happened is what we call the bureaucracy . </s>
and we use this word with such a <unk> . </s>
but it &apos;s this kind of contempt that this thing that we own , and for which we pay to do something that is going to be something that &apos;s going to work , something else , and then we &apos;ll try to ourselves . </s>
people seem to think politics is sexy . </s>
if we want to think that these institution for us , we need to make more amazing . </s>
because this is where the actual <unk> is going to be . </s>
we need to get to the power of government . </s>
so the <unk> has done it . </s>
you &apos;ve seen these guys ? </s>
it &apos;s a group of intense citizens that has a very detailed <unk> report , which is a very detailed response to the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
this is not political , that &apos;s <unk> active . </s>
now for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world we want to leave our children . </s>
you need to imagine the enormous challenges they have to imagine . </s>
we really believe that we can do what we need to do without needing to improve the institution that are the institution of us , in the names of us ? </s>
a government is absolutely necessary to be more efficient . </s>
the good news is that technology can make it possible , the function of the government is in a way that actually accomplish something to be doing a function of the society . </s>
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up the <unk> internet , and the idea that it &apos;s not so hard to do things , you have to build them . </s>
now the average of our happiness is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them . </s>
this is a generation that grew up to see her voice as a no-brainer . </s>
they don &apos;t fight that battle , which we all fight , who can talk ; they all talk about ; they all talk . </s>
you can feel your mind to everybody at any time , and they do it . </s>
so if you faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care about their voices to use their voices . </s>
they use their hands . </s>
they use their hands to write applications that &apos;s the work of the government . </s>
and these applications are let us use our hands to improve our communities . </s>
it could be a fire hydrant , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> hybrid with a <unk> . </s>
and sure enough , we have this fire hydrant , can we have a lot of people doing this . </s>
but these apps are like small memories that we &apos;re not just consumers just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government that are the taxes , and it &apos;s going to be authorized . </s>
we are more than that , we &apos;re selfish citizens . </s>
and we &apos;re going to improve the government , until we make the depth . </s>
so the question i have to do for you all this : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or we will be a lot of hands in your hands ? </s>
thank you . </s>
so , my role is to tell people how wonderful the new technologies that are going to be on the payoff , and i thought i &apos;m going to go back and understand what &apos;s going on to be , and i thought i &apos;m going to go back and to understand what i really think was here i really think , because i &apos;m going to have the whole
i &apos;ll start to show you a single thing , boring slide . </s>
... you could just give you a little bit of a second . </s>
this is a slide that i found randomly randomly happen to happen . </s>
it &apos;s not about the detail of the slide , but rather to be able to shape the shape . </s>
this slide shows data from us from the performance of <unk> processors , compared to a <unk> area . </s>
the interesting here is that this slide , like this , which we often find out in our field , a kind of just a kind of <unk> curve . </s>
in other words , each step here is just a <unk> in the <unk> . </s>
and this is a novelty that we have to test this guy on <unk> curves in the field of technology . </s>
something very bright happened here . </s>
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here . </s>
so if you ask the lights back to the light . </s>
even better , because i &apos;m going to draw something on here , because paper is drawing . </s>
now why do we draw things in technology for the technology in the technology ? </s>
the reason i wanted to draw it on a regular chart where , where , say , that &apos;s the years , where we &apos;re saying that , is that the years of a kind of thing , which i want to draw with a graph , then the silly silly is then the silly silly . </s>
then the look like this . </s>
and that doesn &apos;t say us . </s>
now , if i want to put another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then it would put it on the <unk> of scale , it would be very <unk> , and in a flat line , you line up . </s>
but if something like this is happening , it changes the <unk> scheme . </s>
so if the <unk> looked like the <unk> , then we could put a <unk> in a taxi and in 30 seconds , we would be tokyo in tokyo . </s>
but that &apos;s not going to be so quick . </s>
there &apos;s never been before the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which dissolves all of the few years to exponential exponential . </s>
the question that i want to ask you to ask if you look at these <unk> , you see , you don &apos;t go on forever . </s>
it &apos;s not possible for all over and the way it is now quickly as now . </s>
there are two ways : there are two ways . </s>
either it &apos;s going to be a classic <unk> like here , until something is a bit new , or it &apos;ll be happening here . </s>
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . </s>
well , i &apos;m happy , so i think , is something like this , so something like this , right ? </s>
and then , then , this is what we &apos;re here in the moment in a transition . </s>
we are here on this line , in a transition of the world &apos;s transition to a new kind of world . </s>
so the question i want to ask and i often think about myself , is how this new world will be probably going to be ? </s>
what is this new state of underwear that the world &apos;s been slowly ? </s>
because the exact implication seems very confusing , if you &apos;re in the midst of life . </s>
when i was a kid , because the future is somewhere in 2000 , and people were talking about what would happen to happen in 2000 . </s>
now we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize that the future is still in the year 2000 . </s>
we &apos;re going to go back to the end . </s>
so in other words , the future has been around a year since i &apos;m traveling around the world . </s>
i think the reason is , we &apos;re going to realize that anything is in the way . </s>
the transition is happening . we can all be able to feel . </s>
and we know that there &apos;s no point to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and see 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is so different , because all of which we don &apos;t do not make a sense of doing a sense . </s>
i want to talk about what this might be , that transition in which we &apos;re right now . </s>
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers . </s>
because i think this really can understand this , we have to go back and look at the point on a few <unk> . </s>
and i want to look at the top of the earth &apos;s life of the earth . </s>
i think the big idea makes sense when you get to a few <unk> . </s>
so let &apos;s go back , 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> . </s>
so if you look at the way that chemicals are organized , there &apos;s a pretty good picture of how they do this . </s>
i believe also there are theories that are starting to understand everything in the rna of everything , but i &apos;ll tell you a little story about what &apos;s all of you , but i &apos;ll tell you a little story about what &apos;s <unk> , which different types of <unk> for chemicals . </s>
some of these <unk> <unk> , a particular combination of chemicals , which is allowed to be able to integrate them on the other chemicals from the way of the distribution and so . </s>
all those who were . </s>
these little <unk> were in the sense of the senses . </s>
but they weren &apos;t about to talk about <unk> in the country today , because every single one of them was just a little , <unk> recipe of chemicals . </s>
and every time it broke , they have the same chemicals to be more <unk> chemicals . </s>
so every single baby is a little bit different . </s>
in fact , the <unk> that had been in the growth of the growth of the growth faster than others and the integrated and more chemical and more chemical and <unk> faster . </s>
so , this is a string longer , and they &apos;re going to sell in <unk> . </s>
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is it going to be interesting if these <unk> are a trick of a <unk> trick . </s>
in any way , which we haven &apos;t yet yet understood , this is the ability to have the ability to have the ability to have information <unk> . </s>
they learned to get the recipe of the cell as information to get information and in a particular chemical form that we call dna . </s>
in other words , they &apos;ve found this in the <unk> , evolutionary kind of found that allowed them to be <unk> , what that information was stored and copied . </s>
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to put the time of 2.5 billion years , in which she &apos;s been built . </s>
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from the same code , from the same code , and the same notation . </s>
and that &apos;s every living thing that is the exact same space , and the same code . </s>
we are as far as we are , just to be blowing to <unk> , can make it possible in this code . </s>
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a piece of white <unk> , which i &apos;m in airports in airports in airports . </s>
it &apos;s in the same thing , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code of the code is made of normal letters , which we use to the <unk> -- and i &apos;ve got my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written my <unk> 22 22 times . </s>
so if somebody &apos;s been pregnant copies of copies of my favorite , i want to have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody around the world , and it &apos;s right . </s>
i would be a <unk> , i would have been put it on a virus and in the room . </s>
so what &apos;s next step ? </s>
the <unk> was a interesting one . </s>
and this is the <unk> of these cells -- that made it happy for another billion years . </s>
but then another interesting , very interesting step , where they were completely different , and that &apos;s the cells lead to communicate and information , so that communities are from cells . </s>
i don &apos;t know if you knew it , but bacteria can replace their dna . </s>
so this is why the reason to antibiotics is expanding in antibiotics . </s>
some bacteria have found out of penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria , and now we &apos;ve written each bacteria , which are stored , because the bacteria are going to communicate . </s>
now , this communication is now beginning to start the world that are in the same boat ; they were <unk> . </s>
so they either either survives , or they went out together . that meant that if a community was successful , they were more of the individuals of the community of the community . </s>
the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to the <unk> that they decided to write the recipe for the dna , the recipe for the entire community in a <unk> on dna . </s>
and the next one phase took about a more billion years . </s>
at this point , we have a <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which together as a single organism . </s>
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community . </s>
we &apos;ve been a lot of cells that are not going to be on themselves alone . </s>
your skin cells are useless without cells , muscle cells , and so on . </s>
so these communities started to <unk> , so that the level that occurred , not longer , no longer cell , but the whole <unk> that we call . </s>
the next step is now within this communities . </s>
the <unk> started to be information . </s>
and they developed special structures , which nothing else did nothing to process as information within the organism . </s>
and these are the neural structures . </s>
so the neurons are the <unk> , the <unk> has built these <unk> . </s>
they started to specialists within the community within the community , special structures , which are responsible for learning , understanding and the <unk> of information . </s>
and this was the brain , and the nervous system . </s>
this was a very evolutionary advantage . </s>
because this time , a mathematician -- learning has happened within the time of a single organism , rather than that time , instead of thinking about this evolutionary time . </s>
so , a organism could learn to eat a particular , because she &apos;s bad , and it was sick , that last time he ate her . </s>
now , this could be now within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas before that information was because this information was not going to be the one of the individuals , which is because of these information , because of these , the <unk> , which is that they haven &apos;t yet yet yet yet yet . </s>
so the nervous system has led the <unk> response , because evolution could have been able to solve within a individual location . </s>
it could be able to do within a <unk> . </s>
what happened after that happened is that the individual organisms had to be a way to communicate with each other . </s>
as an example , the <unk> of this is the human language of this pollutant is human language . </s>
it &apos;s fairly amazing undertaking , if you think about it . </s>
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> <unk> of my head . </s>
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;ve basically taken <unk> notes of me to make a similar sense of the subject in your head that has a certain resemblance of my head . </s>
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , and they produce a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the minds of others . </s>
so this is going to be us again as a unified organism . </s>
and what we did in , we have the human race , we have to start to do things . </s>
we &apos;ve been the same stages , which is the <unk> of our own , which is the way we have to do data , is going to process . </s>
the invention of the language was a little bit of a little bit smaller . </s>
<unk> , computer , <unk> , and so on , all our are mechanisms that we built in our community to understand this information . </s>
and it ties all together , which is much bigger , and also , and also , is more quickly to develop when we were so far . </s>
now nowadays , evolution is going to happen in the time . </s>
you &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> <unk> where he was a bit of evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right before your eyes . </s>
now we have the <unk> again . </s>
the first one of the story i told you about a billion years of history , which i told you about a billion years . </s>
the next steps , like nervous and the brain , <unk> a few hundred million years . </s>
then the <unk> steps , like imitation and so on , <unk> less than a million years . </s>
and this next steps , like electronics , seem to take action for a few decades . </s>
the process itself is itself from itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , is that <unk> is the word for this -- when something is its <unk> . </s>
as more changes , the more likely it changes . </s>
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve . </s>
we see the process that &apos;s going to be affected . </s>
i &apos;m living professionally from computers and i know i &apos;m going to have the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the mainly of the cartoon of the brain . </s>
my job is in the same way , objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense . </s>
i don &apos;t know what to do every single transistor in the <unk> . </s>
it has billions of them . </s>
what i &apos;m doing instead , and also the designer of thinking about the <unk> climate <unk> , is we think of a certain <unk> , and the machine power to do something that our ability to be far , and faster than we &apos;ve ever done it . </s>
and it makes it partly with ways we don &apos;t even understand until you . </s>
a method , which is particularly interesting , and i &apos;ve been studying in the last time , i &apos;ve been studying in the last time , it &apos;s evolution . </s>
we put a <unk> in the machine , which is in the machine , which is in the machine . </s>
to call an example , in the extreme cases , we can have a program that &apos;s made from random , in random . </s>
we say , &quot; computer , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , please , <unk> hundred <unk> . </s>
now we &apos;re now now <unk> all of these all <unk> , all of the programs , all of the programs , and there &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be my <unk> of the next door . &quot; </s>
so in other words , i first want to do what i want . </s>
let &apos;s say i want to argue with numbers , which would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve been used for this . </s>
so , the ones that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do . </s>
of course , the chance of all the time , very small , they &apos;re very small , you know , you &apos;re probably going to have the same actually , which is not actually the ones in fact . </s>
but one of those who likes to do something about two numbers in the right order . </s>
now i say , &quot; computer , the most 10 percent of the world &apos;s most of the sequences that are my daily capacity on the next decade . </s>
they &apos;re all the <unk> . </s>
now all the <unk> that have numbers best matching . </s>
and this is a method of <unk> , analogous to breed . &quot; </s>
take two programs and they produce children through their <unk> , and the kids are the kids <unk> the properties of the two programs of the two programs . </s>
now i have a new generation of programs that made a little closer to become the previous world that they have been . </s>
&quot; please repeat this process . &quot; </s>
<unk> . </s>
maybe a few mutations . </s>
and try this again with another generation . </s>
the generations , just for a few milliseconds , you need a few milliseconds . </s>
and so i can go through a loan over time of years in the computer within a computer , or in love for a few hours . </s>
and finally , i &apos;m able to do some evidence that can do perfect numbers . </s>
the fact is so much more efficient than any program that i ever could write . </s>
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work . </s>
i tried to understand them . </s>
it &apos;s been <unk> and strange programs . </s>
but they do it . </s>
i know i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job of the job because they were made of a set of <unk> programs that have been done . </s>
because your life depended on whether they did the job . </s>
i sat in a 747 combined with marvin , <unk> , he <unk> a card and says , &quot; oh look , look . look at this . look at this . look . </s>
there &apos;s this airplane made of <unk> <unk> , which together to make their flight , &apos; power , do you do that ? &quot; </s>
we know that a <unk> is not too complicated , when it &apos;s too complicated . </s>
so we start to rely on computers , for a process , which is both of the classical engineering . </s>
it allows us to deal with a much higher complexity than it would have to be the normal methods of the world , to produce . </s>
and yet , we understand the possibility of it yet . </s>
so <unk> <unk> gives us the technology . </s>
we use these programs to make the computer so that we are capable of doing these ideas are still possible . </s>
so it &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s speeding faster and faster , and i think this is why it seems like that . </s>
because all these new technologies from today &apos;s own technologies . </s>
we &apos;ll raise it . </s>
we &apos;ve been writing at a point where to the analog is to be <unk> , as a <unk> evolved . </s>
so we are the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite yet , all of the things that we &apos;re doing at the hell of what we &apos;re doing here . </s>
we are in this <unk> . </s>
but i really think that after we get a little bit . </s>
i think it &apos;s very <unk> to say that we are the final problem of evolution . </s>
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on . </s>
well , the lunch says before , and i &apos;m thinking , right now , before i &apos;m going to get more <unk> . </s>
my story starts right here in rajasthan , 15 years ago . </s>
i was in the <unk> desert with <unk> <unk> ali . </s>
we talked about that nothing has been transformed in the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot; </s>
if we were to travel , we put into a car and <unk> across the sky . </s>
now we &apos;re going to do this . </s>
back then , when the great indian <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , and it took a bow , and water in the ground and water . </s>
now we &apos;re going to do this with <unk> and machines . </s>
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic through machines were being replaced . </s>
and that was really sad . </s>
i got a bit scared technology . </s>
it made me feel that i could lose a skill , the sunset can enjoy the camera without the camera and without getting it back to my friends . </s>
i found that technology was possible to do it , not kill . </s>
when i was a little girl , my grandfather told me his little <unk> <unk> . </s>
this piece was the <unk> thing for me . </s>
it became a <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships in my mind . </s>
i came to the first direction to dream our teachers clocks and cameras . </s>
they would be inspired by that inspired . </s>
and so i got into the world of technology to see how i could not really get to kill you rather than to kill . </s>
and i started to illustrate books . </s>
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device , the readers to connect around the world . </s>
it can know how we keep it . </s>
it can know where we are . </s>
it &apos;s a load of images and text , animation , sounds and touch . </s>
it &apos;s always increased more senses . </s>
but what do we do with it ? </s>
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> , an interactive operation . </s>
here &apos;s : &quot; look your finger on the light . &quot; </s>
and so -- here &apos;s : &quot; these box , &quot; i write my name . </s>
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book . </s>
again , and again , a letter , i think -- and the ipad white knows where i live -- that &apos;s right to me . </s>
the child is really enthusiastic about this opportunity . </s>
i spoke to talk about magic . </s>
i &apos;m not going to be the wizard and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children . </s>
fireflies in a glass , i was always quite exciting . </s>
so you have to <unk> the ipad and the fireflies of fireflies . </s>
and the <unk> path away from the rest of the book . </s>
another idea that worries me as a kid is that a whole galaxy in a single position can put in a single position . </s>
and so every book , and every world has a little bit of <unk> that i &apos;m trying to get here to the magic device in the device . </s>
and this is a map . </s>
<unk> had been rejected maps , but these maps were static . </s>
this map grows and slide and also interest to orientation in the rest of the book . </s>
it also shows other places of the book . </s>
i &apos;m going to go . </s>
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is <unk> , but also a very <unk> . </s>
these are the <unk> . </s>
we all have a lot of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside of india &apos;s indigenous peoples know their indian indian , the <unk> ? </s>
the poor <unk> were killed in <unk> , in a old book . </s>
and we &apos;ll bring them back , in a contemporary history for children . </s>
a story that stretches to new issues , like the <unk> . </s>
the final problem , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their hands , to their computers , without any one . </s>
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world , we take our children to their technology . </s>
in a interaction of the book , you have to find a search , and you have to be able to get out and with the camera of the ipads that &apos;s worth of the ipads . </s>
when i was a kid , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and somehow , the kids are not going to do . </s>
this is a <unk> <unk> . you have to be able to make it in a while a photograph of a flower and tag . </s>
in another chapter , you have to be a piece of <unk> <unk> and tagging . </s>
so , you actually get a digital collection of photos that you can ask online . </s>
a kid in london , the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox box . &quot; </s>
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen one monkey . &quot; </s>
it creates a kind of social network around the photos that you actually have in . </s>
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to be the world and technology to connect to each other . </s>
and in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction that &apos;s the video of the ipads , and through <unk> reality , a animation from a <unk> , which is a plant from the house . </s>
on one of the screen with the screen , we &apos;re going to deal with mobile . </s>
you have to be the sound of the <unk> , and they &apos;re thinking about the rest of the fittest . </s>
we all move to a world where the earth &apos;s native science is coming and in magic and technology . </s>
we use the power of the sun . </s>
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story . </s>
thank you . </s>
this is really an extraordinary honor for me . </s>
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , <unk> or <unk> . </s>
i spend most of my time with the social water and in places where there &apos;s a lot of us . </s>
here at ted , to see and listen , how stimulating that is , has given me a lot of power . </s>
in the short time , i was a <unk> : ted has a identity . </s>
you can say things that have impact on this . </s>
and sometimes , when something about ted comes , it gets to a sense of a meaning and strength that otherwise otherwise . </s>
i say that , because i think that identity is very important . </s>
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic stuff . </s>
i think we &apos;ve learned that words of a myth , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated to a dedicated words . </s>
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more . </s>
and so i want to talk about power of identity . </s>
i learned not in my work as a lawyer . </s>
i learned this from my grandmother . </s>
i was raised in a family , a traditional <unk> <unk> , who was dominated by a <unk> , and these <unk> was my grandmother . </s>
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had gone . </s>
she had the last word in every <unk> . </s>
she was also the origin of the origin of modern differences in our family . </s>
she was the daughter of a <unk> . </s>
their parents were born in virginia than slaves . </s>
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped their bodies . </s>
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also concerned . </s>
if i met her as a little boy , she came to me and <unk> me . </s>
she &apos;s so determined me that i could barely breathing breathing , then i sat down . </s>
one or two hours later , when i came to her , she came up and said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; you know , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; you know
and when i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to take me again , &quot; when i said , &quot; i got it in love . </s>
and then , in her , something that was told that they were always going to be in their head . </s>
the only problem was that they had 10 children . </s>
my mom was the youngest of your children . </s>
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with your first time with your time , it was difficult to acquire their attention . </s>
all over the world everywhere . </s>
i remember eight or nine , i woke up in the morning and went into the living room . all my cousins was carried around . </s>
my grandmother &apos;s sitting at the end of the <unk> and i staring at me . </s>
first i thought that this game would be . </s>
i saw them and smiled , but she looked very seriously . </s>
this was so 15 or 20 minutes . then she was walking up and i came up to me , and i took them up and i was going to get into the hand , and i said , &quot; come , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i &apos;m not . </s>
i remember it was yesterday . </s>
i never forgot . </s>
she took me out of the outside , and i said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you must have to promise you that you won &apos;t . &quot; </s>
i promised , grandma , grandma . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve observed you . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little special . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything about what you want to do . </s>
i never forgot this . </s>
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to make three things , <unk> . </s>
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; i &apos;m going to love your mommy always loved your mommy . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; mom , your baby is , and you have to have to have to have to promise you to be about them . &quot; </s>
so i said , &quot; yeah , i said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m going to do that . </s>
then she said , &quot; as next to me that you always do the right thing . &quot; it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot; </s>
i thought , &quot; yeah , &quot; i promise it . &quot; </s>
finally said , &quot; the last thing you have to have to have to have to have a promise to me , &quot; is you never have to be alcohol . &quot; </s>
well , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , &quot; yes . i promise it . &quot; </s>
i grew up on the land , rural south , and i have a brother who is a <unk> , and one year is a younger younger sister . </s>
and when i was 14 , 15 , my brother home , and i brought this <unk> beer with the <unk> my sister and me and me and me and the forest . </s>
we just like to see there , too , too . </s>
then he took a groundbreaking beer and offered to my sister &apos;s sister , and she took one of them , and then i &apos;ll just ask me one . </s>
i said , &quot; no , no , no . power . i want to do a beer . &quot; </s>
my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re doing this . today we &apos;re doing whatever it is , you &apos;re doing whatever we do . </s>
i had your sister , and there , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to go . just kidding . </s>
my brother was staring at me . </s>
he said , &quot; what is happening with you ? now , <unk> se . &quot; </s>
then he saw me into the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t know , not always , don &apos;t always do it , because of the conversation with the granny ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; </s>
he said , &quot; well , all the grandchildren that they are . </s>
i was devastated . </s>
i &apos;m going to talk to you . </s>
i should not do that . </s>
this is going to be carried on . </s>
i was 52 years old and i swore that i &apos;ve never been shot in alcohol . </s>
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that , because it &apos;s a power . </s>
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us who they don &apos;t really adore . </s>
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t . </s>
of course , my grandmother &apos;s grandmother all their grandchildren , they &apos;re being used something . </s>
my grandfather was during the prison in prison . </s>
my uncle died of <unk> disease . </s>
and they believed that this is the themes to be the subjects to take care of ourselves . </s>
i tried to say something about our <unk> . </s>
this country is unlike 40 years ago . </s>
in 1972 , 300,000 people in prison and prison . </s>
today , 2.3 million . </s>
the united states is the highest <unk> of the world . </s>
seven million people are on <unk> or <unk> <unk> . </s>
in my view , our world &apos;s radically change . </s>
in social weak and black parts of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population , despair and hopelessness , by this change . </s>
one of three male black black and 30 , in prison , in prison , in prison , in prison , on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> . </s>
in urban communities throughout the country -- from los angeles , on the <unk> , on the washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all the black men , in prison , in prison , in prison , in prison , in prison , on the west . </s>
our system isn &apos;t just <unk> that are with <unk> , it &apos;s going to be <unk> . </s>
we have a <unk> system that you &apos;re doing much better if you &apos;re rich and innocent , and the consequences of poor and innocent . </s>
no , no , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
but we seem to be pleased with it . </s>
a politics fear of fear and anger , convinced us that these problems are not our problems . </s>
we lost touch . </s>
i find this interesting . </s>
there &apos;s a few <unk> developments . </s>
my mom is <unk> , <unk> , if you &apos;re going to be a <unk> . </s>
here , and today , 34 percent of the male population is lost in their <unk> population . </s>
we &apos;ve been seeing that in 10 years , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
that &apos;s what &apos;s happened . </s>
i &apos;m teaching children . </s>
many of my oldest points are very young . </s>
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the <unk> children in prison . </s>
in this country , there are <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ve run a lot of <unk> . </s>
the only country in the world . </s>
i &apos;m going to do people in <unk> . </s>
the death penalty question is an interesting question . </s>
we believe because you &apos;ve been so concerned about that the true question is : &quot; has a man to die for a <unk> planet . </s>
this is a very sensitive question . </s>
you can also think differently , depending on how we see our identity . </s>
the other view is , has someone who deserves a crime death , but it &apos;s like , we &apos;ve got to kill it ? </s>
i find this fascinating . </s>
meanwhile , the death penalty in america . </s>
on average people we &apos;ve been executed , comes out of the things that we &apos;ve been judged for the <unk> and from the death of death . </s>
an amazing <unk> . one of these innocent things . </s>
i find this fascinating . </s>
we would never let somebody with a plane fly with a plane , if for nine , the higgs field , you . </s>
but somehow we do it , we can &apos;t do it , we can do it . </s>
it &apos;s not our problem . </s>
it &apos;s not our burden . </s>
it &apos;s not our fight . </s>
i talk about this questions . </s>
i talk about race and the question that we &apos;re right to kill . </s>
and it &apos;s exciting because i got my students &apos; story . i &apos;m talking about slavery . </s>
i talk about terrorism , the time of the <unk> , to the beginning of the south world war . </s>
we don &apos;t really know much about it . </s>
but for the 10th in this country , it was a time of terror . </s>
in many parts of people were scared to <unk> , and they had to have a <unk> , and in many areas , they had to have a <unk> , and in many areas , they had to have a <unk> , and in many areas , they had to have a <unk> fear , and many people were afraid of <unk> . </s>
or before . </s>
it was the fear that you want to live . </s>
this older people are coming to me and say , &quot; mr , mr , <unk> , they talk about , they &apos;re talking about lectures . they say that for the first time in our nation with terrorism , &quot; after 9 / 11 . &quot; </s>
say , &quot; no -- say no -- say , we grew up with it . </s>
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> . </s>
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country , we don &apos;t know about our issues . </s>
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history . </s>
and so we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are found in the world . </s>
we &apos;re constantly reforming . </s>
we always create new tensions and conflict . </s>
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation . </s>
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not to truth without the willingness to truth and reconciliation . </s>
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was no willingness , but not in this country , we were not in this country . </s>
i &apos;ve given some speeches in germany . </s>
it was amazing , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and i said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply bizarre , it &apos;s like to talk about . </s>
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death penalty . </s>
and of course , it can never be more . &quot; </s>
it was launched quiet . then a woman : the history of our history is impossible to be impossible to ever do for the <unk> people . </s>
it would be foolish by us , and we have a human <unk> . </s>
i thought about it . </s>
as it would be like , in a world where the german state of <unk> people were <unk> , especially when the police were <unk> . </s>
it would be a grim . </s>
it would be <unk> . </s>
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re going to see people -- here &apos;s the risk , to be the risk , to be the risk of the risk , and the victim knows , when it &apos;s black , and the victim knows , in the same states , the body is black in the same way that
and yet , there &apos;s this mental world poll . </s>
i think our identity is . </s>
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult subjects , then they are positive and wonderful things . </s>
we love innovation . </s>
we love technology and creativity . </s>
we love entertainment . </s>
but eventually , this realities of <unk> , abuse , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
i really want to get both of the science . </s>
because we &apos;re ultimately worried about that we need more hope , more commitment to have more commitment to be able to be able to do in a complex world . </s>
for me , the time to think about the time , think , and talk about the poor , the educational that never be in ted . </s>
but think of a way that &apos;s our own life . </s>
we all need to believe in the other day we can &apos;t see . </s>
we do that . so , as we are , we estimate . </s>
innovation , creativity , and development , not only our heads . </s>
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts . </s>
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i think they &apos;re not just open to be just open for all the bright and <unk> things , but for the dark and <unk> . </s>
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said , &quot; i said , &quot; once said , &quot; </s>
when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do anything , but what we needed most of the most needed was hoping to be in places , sometimes to be more convenient to be alive and witness . </s>
now , this mental spiritual orientation is the core of the core i think that the human rights movement must be . </s>
there &apos;s no longer to technology and design that allows us to be completely and human being , as long as we don &apos;t act and ears for poverty , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is much more than if we don &apos;t invent it . </s>
it &apos;s going to be deeply . </s>
as a youngster , i <unk> the great privilege of the <unk> , and the pink , you know , meet a lot of time , to meet , to meet , to meet , to meet , to meet . </s>
his wife &apos;s coming back home , where they came back to <unk> , where they had two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , who had been made to be the <unk> organized , a white whose husband , whose husband , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> . </s>
so these women , and so it &apos;s just going to be just . </s>
and then , at the time , he sat down and then said , &quot; <unk> , woman &apos;s going to city , mrs. earth &apos;s city . we want to talk to the city . we want to talk to the city . we want to talk to the city . we want to talk to the city . we want to talk to the city . we want
do you want to have <unk> and listening ? &quot; </s>
and i said , &quot; yeah , very happy . &quot; </s>
she said , &quot; and what are they going to do , if you are here ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot; </s>
and i went to just just too . </s>
it was so inspiring , so evocative . </s>
and one day i sat there and listened to this women , and after a few hours , woman stood up to me to me , &quot; well , <unk> , say , &quot; well , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot;
what do try to do ? &quot; </s>
i started talking to my usual talk . </s>
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get against injustice . </s>
people want to help people who were innocent . </s>
we want to fight in the <unk> and <unk> . </s>
we want to abolish <unk> <unk> without children for kids . </s>
we want to be the death of death . </s>
we want to cut the numbers of prisoners . </s>
we want to abolish <unk> . </s>
i stopped my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . </s>
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make it very tired . &quot; </s>
then she puts a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so it &apos;s very , very <unk> . &quot; </s>
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> . </s>
we have to put together a way we face all this challenges : these problems , that suffering . </s>
because ultimately our humanity is generating our humanity , from our humanity . </s>
in my work , i learned very simple things . </s>
i learned some simple things happening . </s>
that we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done . </s>
i think that applies for everybody on the planet . </s>
if somebody &apos;s lying , it &apos;s not just a liar . </s>
if somebody assumes something that doesn &apos;t hear him is it &apos;s not just a burglar . </s>
even who somebody who &apos;s ever had one murderer is not just a murderer . </s>
and because that &apos;s what it &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law . </s>
i believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty , the opposite of poverty don &apos;t wealth . </s>
i don &apos;t think that . </s>
i think that &apos;s a few places that &apos;s the opposite of poverty . </s>
and then , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and so , we &apos;re not going to be able to know what we &apos;re doing at the end of the technology , not to the things we &apos;re going to develop not to intellect and minds . </s>
finally , a society isn &apos;t measured how they are going to reach and use and use , but it &apos;s how they treat the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> . </s>
because in this context , we start to start the amazing things that we &apos;re going to make . </s>
sometimes i went . a story to the end . </s>
sometimes i &apos;m very much . </s>
i &apos;m going to be tired of all . </s>
sometimes these ideas are thinking , in some way , in some way . </s>
i &apos;m going to get these kids to become very hard . </s>
i go into the <unk> and visit a <unk> , 13 years old , and the next court is supposed to stand up . </s>
and then i ask myself , how could it happen ? </s>
how can a judge anyone in something that he isn &apos;t ? </s>
the judge looking at him as adults , but i see a child . </s>
one night stayed , i stayed too long and i thought my god , if a judge , if a judge , you have to have <unk> . </s>
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> . </s>
you should have that wish . </s>
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more , i started thinking about a garden . </s>
i had a <unk> , poor boys than they did . </s>
and i started with this character . the headline was : &quot; ah , my arms , <unk> black <unk> , like a <unk> , white <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
in my visit , i explained that the <unk> and policing and feeling <unk> . </s>
there was a crazy line about it , that in this country , nothing more is that there &apos;s nothing more <unk> is that there &apos;s only a lot more . </s>
the next morning i woke up and i couldn &apos;t even know whether i was only <unk> , or it actually written . </s>
and to my surprise , i didn &apos;t just wrote it , but also began to court . </s>
and a few months , i was <unk> , and i had just forgot everything . </s>
but then finally , i decided i got to go and see my god , i must go into the court and this crazy . </s>
i was in the car , and i was really overwhelmed . </s>
i went to court . </s>
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard to look like this . </s>
i finally made out of my car and went to court high . </s>
when i was the staircase , there &apos;s a elderly , black man , who &apos;s in the court . </s>
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot; </s>
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; they are , &quot; they &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; </s>
he came to me and <unk> me . </s>
then he gives me on the ear . </s>
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot; </s>
and i have to say , there &apos;s been a force . </s>
it &apos;s something deeply in my ability to come identity , the ability to each individual , something a community is a community , to one perspective of hope . </s>
well , i was going to go . </s>
once the judge was going to me , and i saw the judge , and i saw the judge , saw the judge . </s>
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , they asked this crazy , &quot; lingua , &quot; you know , they were taking this crazy . </s>
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started to discuss . </s>
more people would be in because they were being angry , and they were <unk> , and they were being annoyed . </s>
i wrote these crazy things . </s>
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and <unk> . </s>
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were outraged , we talked about <unk> languages , over time . </s>
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors on and down . </s>

this <unk> ran over the older black . </s>
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do they do in the <unk> ? &quot; </s>
the older guys man was on . he saw the brooklyn ball , he saw the <unk> , and he was like , &quot; i &apos;m a man to say , you lose the goal , don &apos;t give you on it . </s>
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you understood that the moral universe of the universe , but that it &apos;s the justice <unk> . </s>

if you live in california , there &apos;s in this spring , there &apos;s a <unk> where it &apos;s about to be about to companies , something from the <unk> <unk> , the one of the <unk> <unk> that will take place in politics . </s>
here , in california , in california , you will take a billion dollars for the death penalty years , a billion dollars . </s>
and yet , the percent of all <unk> are not a <unk> . </s>
in the first person of all , the <unk> don &apos;t exist . </s>
there &apos;s the chance to do something . </s>
this <unk> will suggest to invest in more <unk> and safety . </s>
i think there &apos;s opportunity . </s>
during the past three decades , the <unk> is <unk> in america . </s>
this fact is often in a context of <unk> , and they &apos;ve been asked to be asked . </s>
what would you say that , who &apos;s believes ? </s>
well , in fact , the number of <unk> isn &apos;t changed . </s>
the most <unk> in this country is not really in the classroom of the <unk> . </s>
it was the <unk> <unk> against drug drug . </s>
so the dramatic high is numbers in the front door . </s>
we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> from rhetoric to the rhetoric of the rhetoric . </s>
now , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which people always think of the people for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft , rather than good , that you &apos;re doing it , the things that we &apos;re doing . </s>
i think we need to do more to people who victims was not less likely to do it . </s>

so this is just one of the clips that i &apos;ve collected about the last six months -- but the last six days can be , or the last six years . </s>
and the fact is that media prefer to reveal the media problem , because our minds are exactly the same themes that we have just refined . </s>
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this . </s>
every second every day , our senses has a lot more information than our brain . </s>
and because we don &apos;t have anything more than our survival , the first thing for all the information is the information in our <unk> , the amygdala . </s>
so the amygdala is our <unk> , our <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s <unk> the entire information , looking for the search for <unk> in our surroundings . </s>
so if we prefer to the news , we prefer to keep it out of negative news . </s>
and the old adage &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s increasing the demand , &quot; is it true . </s>
now , with all of our digital devices that we spend seven days the week , 24 hours of all the day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re being pessimistic . </s>
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always about true . </s>
but maybe this is not the case . </s>
maybe that &apos;s the reality . </s>
perhaps , the tremendous progress we &apos;ve been inspired by the last century , so that it &apos;s going to us in the next three decades , so that it &apos;s possible to create a world of abundance . </s>
now , i &apos;m not saying we had no big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- that we &apos;ve already done . </s>
and as humans , we &apos;re much better in trouble for the very long term , but they &apos;re going to be there for a long point , but they &apos;re going to be there . </s>
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can change the development . </s>
in the last 100 years , the average lifespan has more doubled than doubled , which is the inflation of the <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s population growth . </s>
child mortality has a water . </s>
and it &apos;s coming to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to have a <unk> . </s>
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently currently in a very peaceful period of life . </s>

and we &apos;re going to continue to do our expectations . </s>
in fact , we have poverty . </s>
think that a great percentage of americans , the ones that live below poverty , access to electricity , water , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . </s>
the richest <unk> of the past century , the earth &apos;s circulatory systems , the earth &apos;s never would have dreamed of these <unk> . </s>
the foundation for many of these are <unk> technologies , and these are growing . </s>
my good friend ray kurzweil gave us that every tool that is , every tool that is information to information , on the design of moore &apos;s law , and all 12 to 24 hours to 24 months . </s>
so that &apos;s the mobile phone in your wallet about a million times less times less than a grandmaster , and it &apos;s been evolving faster than a grandmaster . </s>
now look at this curve . </s>
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years . </s>
notice two things about this curve . </s>
first , how do you think about -- in good , war like &quot; vagina , war , recession , depression and <unk> . </s>
this is the result of <unk> computers , the <unk> computers . </s>
it &apos;s acting for none of our big issues . </s>
and , despite your <unk> , on the left-hand side , they put together . </s>
so the rate itself is accelerating . </s>
and on this curve , on the backs of moore &apos;s law , we find a bunch of extraordinary technologies that everybody &apos;s available . </s>
&quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk is called &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors , robots , and robots , digital medicine , digital medicine , digital , digital medicine , digital medicine , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial intelligence . </s>
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer called &quot; jeopardy &quot; ? &quot; </s>
that was scary . </s>
i &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> and the best headlines i could find . </s>
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human opponent . &quot; </s>
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game . </s>
it &apos;s about embracing the ability of language . </s>
imagine that these artificial intelligence of a <unk> is going to be a <unk> owner of a <unk> . </s>
four years ago , i was <unk> kurzweil , and i here at ted a new university called &quot; singularity university . &quot; </s>
we bring our students all these technologies , with your focus on how to be used to solve the big challenges of human being . </s>
and every year we ask students , businesses , products and services , the services within a positive positive , that we can transform the lives of billions of people . </s>
think about that , a group of students today can affect the lives of people today . </s>
thirty years ago , this is ridiculous . </s>
today we can have done about companies that have been done right . </s>
if i think about it , i mean , i mean , i &apos;m not going to live a life on this planet , it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunity . </s>
it &apos;s about embracing awareness of the pacific goods . </s>
and it &apos;s <unk> , and technology is a resource market force . </s>
here &apos;s an example . </s>
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century . </s>
he &apos;s the guy left . </s>
he had the king of <unk> to dinner . </s>

king of <unk> , <unk> . </s>
and at this time , the most powerful metal is the largest metal on the planet , valuable as a gold and <unk> . </s>
this is why the main dome out of aluminum is written . </s>
although , although <unk> percent of the <unk> is , not as a <unk> metal . </s>
it &apos;s going to be connected by oxygen and <unk> . </s>
but then the technology of the <unk> was developed and made it <unk> so much that we use it to our <unk> . </s>
let us take a quick note in the future . </s>
we think about <unk> . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet with <unk> more energy than we &apos;re using a year . </s>
16 energy all of the world &apos;s population is on earth . </s>
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is . </s>
and there &apos;s good news . </s>
in this year , you &apos;ve got the first time to put 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees in the <unk> warehouse , in the <unk> warehouse , in the 17 . </s>
the cost of solar last year to 50 percent . </s>
so , last month , this is a study that shows that to end in this decade , this decade , that one decade in the end of this decade , this decade , in the sunny areas of the u.s. at 15 cents in the national average . </s>
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll be able to do water on abundance . </s>
let &apos;s talk about <unk> . </s>
remember , as carl sagan was 1990 when it was the <unk> in saturn , back back in saturn ? </s>
he took a famous photograph . how did it was ? </s>
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot; </s>
because we live on a life life . </s>
we live on a planet that &apos;s too 70 percent with water . </s>
yeah , there are more abundant percent , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;ve been fighting the power of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope . </s>
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now . </s>
it &apos;s new <unk> on the road , <unk> . </s>
and from a conversation today , with dean ornish <unk> , one of the innovators of the puzzle , i want to share with you -- his <unk> , the <unk> &quot; is , &quot; and many of you may have heard of the size of a <unk> in the <unk> . </s>
it can be a thousand liters of drinking water , a day of different sources -- whether it &apos;s saltwater , underwater , underwater , underwater , -- and all of that is a less cents per two cents a gallon . </s>
the <unk> has just <unk> , a big <unk> with a hundred units with a hundred units with a hundred units . </s>
and when everything is good , and i &apos;m very hopeful , then this technology will be able to apply this technology in <unk> countries on the entire planet . </s>
this is <unk> innovation that is now . </s>
and we &apos;ve seen this in the face . </s>
you mean , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of the <unk> of <unk> in the world . </s>
think about that one cell phone in the middle of kenya , a <unk> <unk> has a better <unk> than president years ago . </s>
and if you look at your smartphone on google , they &apos;ve got to know more access to the google , and information than president clinton 15 years ago . </s>
they live in a world that information and communications basically , how it could ever have been possible . </s>
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i have several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , and technology , technology , <unk> and <unk> , and i mean , libraries of medical imaging -- are literally literally <unk> and cheaper cheaper . </s>
and the best part is possibly in the world health . </s>
last month , i had the pleasure to the <unk> , the <unk> asked to the last month , 10 million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re going to ask people to the world , all these technologies are interconnected together in a sense that you can talk to the machine , you can talk to the proportions , you can actually test your <unk> or your <unk> . </s>
and to win , they have to provide an better diagnosis as a team of <unk> . </s>
imagine this device , right in a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the american revolution . </s>
if this device has a <unk> or a <unk> catastrophe , which is not known , &quot; you know , the <unk> and making a pandemic from their head . </s>
but now , the biggest force that lead to a world of abundance . </s>
i call them &quot; the &quot; one billion . &quot; </s>
the white lines are happening . </s>
we &apos;ve just got the <unk> . </s>
and just by the way , the biggest <unk> of a trillion is an better education and diet in the world . </s>
in 2010 , we had under two billion people each other online . </s>
by 2020 , we moved two to five billion <unk> . </s>
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , is the global communication system . </s>
what do these people ? </s>
what are you consume ? what are you going to kill ? what are you going to be ? </s>
and instead of a standstill , i &apos;m going to see one of the greatest economic history of history . </s>
these people are <unk> dollars that are going to be carried into global economy . </s>
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the <unk> of the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be better by the <unk> , and that they are going to be able to have the opportunity to have the opportunity to have the opportunity to have the opportunity to have the opportunity to be the opportunity to be as much as productive as a problem . </s>
so what can three billion of the growing , healthy , <unk> , <unk> members of the <unk> will bring us ? </s>
how about a sentence , never had a sentence , never before . </s>
how about it that , the damage , wherever they are , a vote to make spontaneous , to make more comfortable , and change , for the first time , for the first time ? </s>
what are these three billion people ? </s>
how about the <unk> that we can &apos;t predict ? </s>
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams that ripple through passion and focus , extraordinary things , extraordinary things , extraordinary companies , extraordinary businesses , and governments are just able to do in the past . </s>
i want to finish with a story that really excites me . </s>
there &apos;s a program that maybe some might know . </s>
it &apos;s a game called the world . </s>
it was developed in seattle , in seattle . </s>
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids , to explore what the protein is going to be evolving . </s>
and the way we can do the structure and function . </s>
and this is very important in the <unk> . </s>
so far , this was a problem for the supercomputer . </s>
and this game was played on , by the university . </s>
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played online playing the game online . </s>
and it turns out that today , the human drivers are substantially better to the proteins than the best part . </s>
and when they came and looked at who who &apos;s the best <unk> of the world , was not a <unk> , not a woman , who was a <unk> , <unk> , who was a woman who was a woman who was a <unk> , and the world &apos;s best <unk> in the world . </s>
ladies and gentlemen , what i mean to see is that we &apos;ve got more power to live more power to be more power to put ourselves more than individuals to put ourselves . </s>
we &apos;ve access to tools with raw <unk> technology . </s>
we have the passion of a <unk> . </s>
we &apos;ve got the capital of the <unk> . </s>
and we &apos;ve three billion new minds that we work online , and to do what is necessary . </s>
we expect a few other cell . </s>
thank you . </s>
i think we have to be a <unk> piece of the culture of culture . </s>
and i think it &apos;s a medical piece and that i &apos;m . </s>
and i &apos;m a long time in the business , when i can allow me to make a piece of my own wrong system to enable this . </s>
before i come to the actual theme of my talk about my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of a baseball . </s>
why not ? </s>
we are the <unk> and swing us to the world . </s>
we all love baseball , right ? </s>
baseball is full statistics . </s>
and there are hundreds of them . </s>
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon , and it rotates to make a great baseball team team . </s>
i &apos;m going to show you a statistic of hope that most of you have heard about . </s>
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re talking about a 300 300 , if a peak of a <unk> . </s>
that means that the players is three three times , it tolls to be . </s>
that means that the ball hits the beating , he &apos;s coming in , he &apos;s not going to be caught , and whoever has tried to take the ball to the edge , it wasn &apos;t on it , it wasn &apos;t on it , it wasn &apos;t on it , in fact , it was in safety . </s>
10th out of 10 dollars around the 10th . </s>
you know , like you call a <unk> in <unk> baseball . </s>
well , really , maybe a <unk> . </s>
you know how to call a <unk> ? </s>
this is somebody who &apos;s going to be transformed in the rest of 10 . </s>
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
let &apos;s go back to my world , i &apos;m going to feel a lot of a lot of some pretty much less than a little bit less than i talked about it . </s>
suppose you have a <unk> and they &apos;re going to have a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> breast cancer , which is <unk> in terms of <unk> . </s>
it doesn &apos;t work , right ? </s>
imagine you live in a particular remote people , and you have a <unk> people with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to a <unk> , whose <unk> <unk> is <unk> in 200 . </s>
but , you know what ? </s>
it &apos;s this year much better . she &apos;s on the <unk> branch . </s>
and she &apos;s carrying a <unk> . </s>
it doesn &apos;t work . </s>
but i &apos;ll ask you a question . </s>
what do you think the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse , a nurse , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ? </s>
1,000 , very good . </s>
the truth is that no one should know what a good shelter or doctor or doctor or a doctor . </s>
what we do is we &apos;re going to be in every one of them , including me , to be connected with the rest of being perfectly perfect . </s>
never make a mistake , no one is supposed to be about the details of how this would be done . </s>
and this is the message i &apos;m in the arts . </s>
i was a <unk> student student . </s>
in high school , you know , that brian <unk> was going to be told that brian <unk> for a <unk> . </s>
and so it was also . </s>
and i learned in my little <unk> in the <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of the toronto of the toronto of the toronto of the toronto of the toronto of the toronto of the toronto of the toronto of the <unk> . </s>
i learned everything . </s>
in my <unk> , i learned the origins of <unk> and i &apos;m a <unk> , every branch , every branch of a crash , which is the <unk> of the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> . </s>
i knew the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
and i &apos;ve collected more and more knowledge . </s>
and i was good , i closed up with <unk> <unk> . </s>
and i left the most fascinating thing that i was doing everything that i knew all of the way that i knew everything and all the things that i knew , or at least as as as as as as close as possible that i was against the least of the sounds of mistakes . </s>
and it took for a while i met woman , until i met a printer . </s>
i <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto , when i was given to my prison , i was going to be brought into the township of the hospital . </s>
at this point , i was in the middle of the <unk> service layer in the middle of the <unk> service . </s>
and it was my mission to investigate the <unk> <unk> of advice , the <unk> . </s>
and to give me a feedback and to give my <unk> . </s>
i was a woman and she was in <unk> . </s>
and when i was writing her , made it <unk> sounds . </s>
and when i was breast , i was able to hear a <unk> sound on both sides that they were underwater <unk> <unk> . </s>
this is a state in which the heart of the heart , instead of the entire blood , the entire blood moves , is a part of the land in the lungs , and they came out , so the <unk> . </s>
and that was not a hard to be diagnosis . </s>
i was trying to participate me on the treatment . </s>
i gave her <unk> . i gave her to take her pressure from the heart . </s>
i gave her medicine , which we call <unk> , water , so that they &apos;re going to liquid the liquid . </s>
and then , over a year , i began to feel better than two hours . </s>
i was really good at all . </s>
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home . </s>
i was actually making two mistakes . </s>
i sent home to talk to my talk . </s>
i didn &apos;t look at what i would have to have been to have been a call at my <unk> , so that he would have had a chance to make a own picture . </s>
and he knew he would be able to get additional information to her . </s>
maybe i did it with good reason . </s>
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a doctor . </s>
maybe i wanted to take the way so important to take responsibility that i was so so that i was so so that i was able to provide in the patients without having to care about it . </s>
my second mistake was worse . </s>
so that &apos;s what i sent home , i <unk> a quietly voice in me who trying to say , &quot; <unk> , not a good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot; </s>
in fact , i was so excited about that i asked her woman , &quot; do you think that &apos;s fine when you go home ? &quot; </s>
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go to her . &quot; </s>
i remember it yesterday . </s>
so i decided to wipe the <unk> and a <unk> and <unk> and brought home . </s>
and i started walking back to work . </s>
the night i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach . </s>
but i was working on . </s>
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my mind , and i got the hospital , and i went to the car home , when i did something i didn &apos;t do that . </s>
i went home to my home home . </s>
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the sister &apos;s going to the woman , but another three words , i &apos;ve been afraid of the other <unk> i know most of the ones i know . </s>
other medical species of fear , but the <unk> is very , especially because we &apos;re just seeing the patient &apos;s patients . </s>
the three words , remember , remember ? </s>
&quot; remember the patients , they &apos;re doing in the patients ? &quot; </s>
asked the nurse . </s>
&quot; so she said , &quot; she said to this particular <unk> . </s>
so she was back . </s>
she was back and on the die . </s>
she was about an hour after you had home , after i was at home , and they would stop the family called 911 , and they would stop at the <unk> with a pressure of 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous troublemaker . </s>
she was going to barely blue <unk> . </s>
the <unk> is constantly all the way . </s>
they were <unk> . </s>
they put them on the <unk> . </s>
i was shocked to the inner city hall . </s>
and i really picked these <unk> , because they came up after the intensive care came and i would expect that they would recover . </s>
and after two , three days , they never would have been back to the same . </s>
she had a <unk> <unk> . </s>
their family is supposed to be . </s>
and over the next eight or nine days , they don &apos;t think about the <unk> . </s>
they go on the <unk> day -- woman printer , a mother and grandmother . </s>
you say that you never say the names of the <unk> . </s>
and this was the first time that i &apos;ve been doing this . </s>
the next weeks i did was , and i &apos;ve been following the first time the unhealthy , the unhealthy shame that in our medical culture -- i felt like i was alone , is not the kind of <unk> shame , because you cannot talk to talk about it . </s>
you know all the time you have a secret of the best friend , even though this one is on <unk> , and then you get caught in a very , horrible , and then you get a horrible debate , if you have a very horrible discussion , and you institutionalized that you never do a bug again . </s>
if you &apos;re going to make a mistake , and it never makes it back . </s>
this is the kind of <unk> shame . </s>
the professionals of the things i &apos;m talking about is that one of sick sick is sick . </s>
it &apos;s the one that &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t do what you do badly , but it &apos;s not really bad . </s>
and that was what i felt . </s>
and it wasn &apos;t on the reason he was very dear . </s>
he was talking about the family and i &apos;m sure that he would be the <unk> and i realized that i was not going to be sued . </s>
but i asked myself to ask these questions . </s>
why did i ask the <unk> , why did i do you home ? </s>
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ? </s>
why am i going to medicine ? </s>
slowly it &apos;s going to be on . </s>
i started feeling better . </s>
and then a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun and the sun and i told me maybe i can feel better . </s>
and i was like , i &apos;m afraid that if i had my efforts to perfection my efforts to perfection , and never had a mistake that could <unk> the voice <unk> . </s>
and she did . </s>
and i worked on . </s>
and then it &apos;s over again . </s>
two years later , i had six service in the <unk> in a <unk> hospital at a <unk> north of toronto , and i was <unk> for a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> . </s>
it was much better and i &apos;m in a hurry . </s>
he &apos;s always going to be here . </s>
i was looking at the <unk> and it was a little bit pink . </s>
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him to penicillin . </s>
and then when he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> . </s>
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in her office . </s>
and she said , remember , remember , remember ? </s>
&quot; you remember the patient &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; </s>
it turned out that it &apos;s a <unk> . </s>
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> . </s>
you can see the debut , but it &apos;s not a <unk> of the <unk> , but the upper scaffolding and causes the actual <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
and he didn &apos;t know . </s>
he got <unk> <unk> and <unk> a few days later . </s>
and i went back through the same time of space and self-doubt , and went to <unk> me and went to the work of work and back again and again . </s>
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve got a <unk> speaker . </s>
there &apos;s a lot more recently , especially if you think that you &apos;re in a hospital that &apos;s only 14 times a day , that &apos;s only 14 times a day . </s>
in both cases , i sent them home and i didn &apos;t have any imperfections in their treatment . </s>
i thought he was <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m pushing the x-ray of the kidneys . when the <unk> was <unk> , my colleague at the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s <unk> of the patient &apos;s icy , the patient &apos;s <unk> in the lower right , and called the <unk> . </s>
the other had a strong diarrhea . </s>
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> and asked him to <unk> and asked him to be able to do it . </s>
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was an <unk> in the right , called the <unk> . </s>
in both cases , <unk> and it was good . </s>
both cases <unk> to me , <unk> me . </s>
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors has just been given to the first five years , what many of my colleagues , but total nonsense . </s>
now , in my <unk> , i happened in the last five years . </s>
they were alone and without support . </s>
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not talking to my scientific , and talk about you , if i was the quiet voice , i &apos;m going to say , how can i share it with my colleagues ? </s>
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they couldn &apos;t commit to be the same thing ? </s>
if i was in a room , like right now , i &apos;ve got no idea what was going on me . </s>
when did you hear the last time you heard of <unk> about <unk> <unk> ? </s>
oh , you go to a cocktail party , and you might like to talk about any other , but you don &apos;t hear somebody about the way you &apos;re going to talk about . </s>
if i just filled with colleagues , and to tell their immediate support and to tell you what i just told you , if somebody would take a joke , you would have a joke , you would have a subject and forgetting the rest . </s>
and in fact , when i knew my colleagues , that a <unk> in my hospital was awarded the wrong leg , then i believe i would have trouble to look at the eyes . </s>
that &apos;s where we live in . </s>
it &apos;s totally disconnected , and it &apos;s totally &apos;s essential . </s>
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who do mistakes and those who are not <unk> , which are <unk> and the <unk> that are <unk> , who are <unk> with bad outcomes and the ones that are working with good . </s>
it &apos;s almost a <unk> response to the antibodies that makes a human . </s>
and there &apos;s the idea that if we were making the ones that make errors , that we have a secure system . </s>
but there are two problems . </s>
in my talk about 20 years , i &apos;ve got a personal medical study about medical imaging and wrong for the toronto to my show &quot; white <unk> , black , black . </s>
and what i learned is that errors is absolutely <unk> . </s>
we &apos;re working in a system in which every single day , a wrong person either day or wrong , or wrong , in the <unk> , and it &apos;s still going to be more and more and more and more and more or dead . </s>
in this state , you know about 24,000 canadians , <unk> . </s>
in the united states , the institute of medicine , the number of <unk> . </s>
both are both <unk> because we don &apos;t look at the problem as just as we should . </s>
and is the <unk> . </s>
in a <unk> , in the world , all two to three years , we can &apos;t do it in the world . </s>
<unk> is ubiquitous . </s>
we can &apos;t get it . </s>
we have cognitive mistakes so that we could take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest . </s>
then i take the same patient with <unk> , making it <unk> and <unk> and give you a very easily system , and suddenly , the story is <unk> with contempt . </s>
i don &apos;t take the same one . </s>
i &apos;m not going to be doing things ; i don &apos;t always see things . </s>
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always repeat their symptoms in the same way . </s>
all of these are errors . </s>
so if you take the system , you know , as i was taught , and all the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s not the end , then they get no more left . </s>
and you know the most powerful people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ? </s>
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which i have to say , &quot; this is my worst error , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with your worst , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you the microphone .
and then your bubble , they &apos;re faced with the head , then they look down and to make a little bit hard to tell their stories . </s>
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories . </s>
you want to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t mistakes the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot; </s>
what you need is a local setting that they need to be able to do it . </s>
what you need is a new medical culture . </s>
and it starts with a doctor . </s>
the newly likes to teach the doctor &apos;s a human being , to be your humanity , they &apos;re not supposed to make mistakes , but it &apos;s all of you learn from them . </s>
they share their experience with others . </s>
they supported the other from their mistakes . </s>
and they don &apos;t mistake other errors , not to <unk> , but in a learning , that &apos;s in a learning , in a learning , that &apos;s kind of like all of them benefit from them . </s>
and they &apos;re working in a medical culture that recognizes the system , and if that &apos;s how that is , then , is making mistakes at the time . </s>
so that system has developed this system in creating this system that makes it easier to make it easier , and it also make more inclusive , and it &apos;s that , specifically for people like me , who are making mistakes and the most specifically of these rewards are going to be avoided . </s>
my name is brian <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m the newly cell doctor . </s>
i &apos;m a man . i do mistakes . </s>
i &apos;m also trying to learn it possible to learn it to other people . </s>
i don &apos;t know what you hold from me , but i can live . </s>
let me wrap me with three of my own words : i remember . </s>
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea . </s>
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> . </s>
and because you can tell you this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use the time . </s>
the first story is the size of charles darwin , one of my heroes . </s>
you know , he was here . </s>
you may think that it &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true . </s>
it &apos;s actually <unk> . </s>
he described one of them as a very , very humble . </s>
it was a <unk> . </s>
and in the mid- &apos; 80s , he was going to be in big style . </s>
now he &apos;s looking at the red list of the list . </s>
this story we have a lot of times from the galapagos , or other places , it &apos;s not very special . </s>
we still have to be on the galapagos . </s>
we still think they &apos;re originally . </s>
the <unk> are still fighting them as a untouched . </s>
what &apos;s happening here ? </s>
the second story is to be a different concept , the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> . </s>
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i was a professional school in <unk> . </s>
i went there , because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa later . </s>
i thought i could go to me . </s>
and i got a bad hippie , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t from there . </s>
it was my first <unk> . </s>
as you see , the lagoon was responding by <unk> and some of the <unk> . </s>
it was about 20 <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> . </s>
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and fishermen were living in ghana , and made of all the fishermen were fine . </s>
when i got married , after the fish of half was the fish of half of his size . </s>
she &apos;s five centimeters . </s>
they were genetically modified . </s>
it was always a couple of times . </s>
people were always happy . </s>
and the fish was fortunate to be there . </s>
so it changes , and yet changed everything . </s>
my third little story of my <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> in asia . </s>
in the &apos; 70s -- the <unk> europe has a lot of <unk> in the &apos; 70s -- <unk> europe . </s>
<unk> <unk> who had been <unk> , the industrial fishing has been this very ugly , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s>
i was looking at this , and we made it <unk> throughout the southern <unk> ocean , especially in the <unk> . </s>
we had no words for what we started to eradicate . </s>
i know it was the reason it was . </s>
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason . </s>
the greatest part of the fish , the little dots on the rubble , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> . </s>
in essence came on the ocean , and then they <unk> . </s>
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very quick . </s>
within a year , you put a <unk> , and then it starts with the <unk> . </s>
the reason is , in this case , in this case -- a hard reason coral coral reef . </s>
this is a dead duck . </s>
they weren &apos;t eaten , they were given them because they were dead . </s>
we started a <unk> . </s>
she wasn &apos;t yet <unk> . </s>
they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them . </s>
in fact , this mountain of <unk> , in fishermen , when they drive into areas in the world , in which they &apos;ve never been . </s>
it &apos;s not going to be a small . </s>
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it . </s>
we adjust our <unk> to new level , and we don &apos;t know what was there . </s>
if you look at it , what happens . </s>
and on the y-axis , the few things are a few good things : biodiversity , the <unk> of the <unk> that are the <unk> . </s>
and it &apos;s changing it . it changes , because for people are their actions , obviously . </s>
every generation of the generation , they look at the beginning of their conscious , when the default and it &apos;s going to be driven by it . </s>
the difference is then as a loss . </s>
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses . </s>
it can be a order of change . </s>
and they want to get the <unk> pictures . </s>
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to do this . </s>
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not as much as they were . </s>
you might think that the problem of people who certainly were sure they were in <unk> societies , animals , and they had been following a few generations , what they did . </s>
because obviously , a animal that there was very often , just before it <unk> . </s>
so you lose no other cell phone . </s>
you always lose other animals . </s>
and therefore it isn &apos;t as big loss . </s>
so , with the time we &apos;re focused on the big animals , and we are the big fish . </s>
they &apos;re going to start because we &apos;re catching them . </s>
and the time is a little fish , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> . </s>
the question is , why people accept this . </s>
well , because they don &apos;t know that it &apos;s different . </s>
of course , many people , scientists , who was really different . </s>
they &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence in a previous shape , not as they &apos;d like to be . </s>
so for instance , the anecdote that the report of a <unk> <unk> , which is not used , not being able to be able to be able to not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to not be able to recover because it doesn &apos;t <unk> . </s>
so we &apos;ve got the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we &apos;re in teaching societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past . </s>
this is enormous big role that can play a marine control . </s>
because we put the past , we basically put the past . </s>
we put the past , people who don &apos;t understand people , because the <unk> is changing , and very low . </s>
so , with the people who can see a marine vision and the ones that allowed the entire benefit to raise their waste users . </s>
what is happening with people who don &apos;t have to be possible because they don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the middle of the middle for instance ? </s>
here , i think the art and the video may fill the gap and the movie may fill . </s>
this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay . </s>
there was a long time ago -- 500 years ago . </s>
and the <unk> and <unk> may remember you might be in avatar . </s>
and if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so concerned about it as they were so concerned about it -- except from the <unk> , why were they touched from the <unk> ? </s>
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a <unk> , which is lost in a way . </s>
so my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to spend on cameron , so he can put it in &quot; avatar &quot; avatar . </s>
thank you . </s>
in the &apos; 80s , in communist <unk> , you had to get a typewriter , this is the government of <unk> . </s>
they had to have a sheet of <unk> from this <unk> . </s>
the reason for this : the government could come in , where a text . </s>
they found a paper with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the lowest one of the creator of this thought . </s>
and we could not understand how anyone could do something like anyone could do , and how do they make the noise . </s>
in our own countries , we would never do anything . </s>
but if you &apos;re in the year 2011 , a new <unk> of the leading <unk> from the leading <unk> and one page , then this side , the first thing yellow <unk> on every page is <unk> , in a pattern that page clearly reflect into it and their printer . </s>
this is happening to us . </s>
and it &apos;s just not a <unk> . </s>
and this was an example of what our own governments are distributing technology , the citizen , to use . </s>
and this is one of the three <unk> of the surgical <unk> . </s>
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks of the attacks . </s>
we &apos;ve got three <unk> . </s>
there are <unk> . </s>
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> in ukraine in ukraine . </s>
and the motivation of <unk> are very easy to understand . </s>
these people make money . </s>
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge bunch of money . </s>
there &apos;s several well-known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who have been through their money . </s>
this is <unk> <unk> in estonia in estonia . </s>
this is alfred hitchcock . </s>
stephen watts . </s>
<unk> <unk> . </s>
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on . </s>
these people are online , but they &apos;ve been illegal to <unk> , using them to <unk> , and they &apos;ve got to <unk> , using our <unk> , or <unk> , which our <unk> counterparts in the study of the keyboard , as we might buy our <unk> computer online . </s>
the american loads of <unk> suggested two months ago by mr. teszler here , and on this came here , and on this came to be a <unk> million dollars in this morning , when it was frozen . </s>
mr. &apos;s <unk> , the <unk> is unknown . </s>
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely that we &apos;re victims of a <unk> , as a <unk> in the real world . </s>
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just worse . </s>
in the future , most of the world &apos;s online . </s>
the second largest <unk> that we can see , not by money , are not a <unk> . </s>
they &apos;re through something else , protests , a opinion , or you &apos;re talking about your audience . </s>
now groups like anonymous months , and they &apos;re <unk> on a <unk> on the field of <unk> . </s>
so these are three <unk> : criminals , the <unk> of money , <unk> of how anonymous ones that are being able to change that , but the last group are nations , governments that have attacks . </s>
there &apos;s a cases of <unk> , like the <unk> . </s>
it tells a <unk> , what happens when governments make your own income . </s>
<unk> is a <unk> view of the netherlands -- in fact it was . </s>
in the last autumn , it had to <unk> , because <unk> was hacked . </s>
somebody was , and had the system <unk> . </s>
and last week in a meeting with me , i asked one of the senior of the questions that he asked him for the question that he had died for the <unk> people . </s>
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot; </s>
well , how are people dying in a different one ? </s>
<unk> is a <unk> . </s>
they sell <unk> . </s>
what do you do with <unk> ? </s>
now , a certificate to take a certificate when you have a website with <unk> , with <unk> , in the middle of the liver . </s>
now we &apos;re all , or many of us , <unk> , gmail or one of your competitors , but these services are particularly superior in <unk> states like gmail , so that the local government is not able to trust the local government , so that the local government is not able to do with their own <unk> . </s>
can you yet , if you look at a foreign night . </s>
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s>
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the case of <unk> . </s>
how behaves it moves into arab spring and the things that are going to happen to be in egypt ? </s>
now in egypt , the most round of april has exploded the headquarters of egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of them . </s>
in this economy , in these records called &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s>
and in this folder , in this folder , in germany , in germany , in germany , company , the egyptian government officials have sold a few programs that they were sold -- that <unk> communications could intervene . </s>
they had sold to the egyptian government . </s>
this is exactly there . </s>
so , bright western governments are experimenting with <unk> , so that they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
but the western governments are also able to help themselves . </s>
for example , just a few weeks ago , this was a <unk> <unk> , who was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens . </s>
if you &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> , then you &apos;re going to be your <unk> <unk> . </s>
but today we are far beyond that . </s>
she found your internet . </s>
they use means how to make your computer with a <unk> <unk> that allows you to monitor your own communication to monitor their own communication , their <unk> <unk> . </s>
so if we continue to think about things like these things , the obvious response of the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen . </s>
i don &apos;t have to worry about it . </s>
i haven &apos;t got anything to hide . &quot; </s>
and these arguments makes no sense . </s>
privacy must be given . </s>
privacy is not the debate . </s>
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety . </s>
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control . </s>
and as we were today , in 2011 , our governments , is that we &apos;re going to trust that , but we &apos;re always going to be forever . </s>
and we trust , we trust a whole bunch of a government , a government that we might have already have been in a period ? </s>
these are the questions that we have to deal with us to deal with us . </s>
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> . </s>
the first <unk> were <unk> <unk> , and <unk> lovins : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , they would fit . </s>
<unk> were very quickly in the world , and they were very quickly in the world . </s>
they &apos;ve been able to build things that were bigger than we were , buildings , bridges , a pebble in the others . </s>
it was the <unk> for the earth &apos;s just been . </s>
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , and then came out . </s>
it was called <unk> rock . </s>
and within a few years , the rise of every household . </s>
it &apos;s estimated that , over 400 billion stones -- or 75 to each person on this planet . </s>
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful bridges or nice building . </s>
lego : i made it possible for everyone . </s>
lego : the <unk> of the world , taken and <unk> a block for our imagination . </s>
in the meanwhile , the next year , the next year , the next revolution , the next building block . </s>
the transistor was a little <unk> that was given us from a world of static , <unk> building blocks of a world that was initiated . </s>
as the <unk> , allowing us to build more complex , more complex , more complex , a pebble after the others . </s>
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for me . </s>
i personally don &apos;t know that the world &apos;s time for experts is , and therefore i decided to change that . </s>
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started thinking about this idea , how do you make the power of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers . </s>
some years ago , i started to develop a <unk> . </s>
let me show you how they work . </s>
<unk> are electronic times that have a specific function . </s>
they &apos;re <unk> , light , motor and sensor . </s>
and the best part is that they are connecting with magnets . </s>
so they can &apos;t untie around the front door . </s>
stones are <unk> . </s>
green is regenerative , blue is input and orange , it &apos;s cable . </s>
all you need to do is a blue and a green interconnected and they can build quickly bigger growth . </s>
you &apos;re going blue to a green , and you can make light . </s>
they can switch in and so you have a little <unk> . </s>
take the switch out there &apos;s a <unk> , which is there , and they &apos;ve made a little bit of <unk> . </s>
and then you add this <unk> for a <unk> effect , and they have a <unk> . </s>
i &apos;m going to stop this . </s>
and beyond the simple game , actually quite a <unk> indeed . </s>
instead of programming code , <unk> or <unk> , you have to have simple , intuitive gestures , intuitive gestures . </s>
so to just take the <unk> or slow , just swing that button and he makes the momentum faster . </s>
the idea of <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library . </s>
we want to put each one of the atom in this world in a <unk> rock . </s>
lights , sounds , <unk> , engines , engines , motors -- everything should be available . </s>
we &apos;ve spread on kids and they &apos;re playing with this . </s>
and it was an unbelievable experience . </s>
the most beautiful is , as they start to start the electronics that you &apos;re doing in day-to-day and not learning to the school . </s>
like for example , a <unk> , it works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or like a ipod responds to touch . </s>
we also have <unk> to <unk> . </s>
so we had no experience with no experience in electronic things that started using <unk> as material . </s>
here we see here with <unk> , paper and water , like <unk> , and <unk> ... </s>
a few weeks ago we brought to risd , and they gave them some designers that no longer technical experience -- just beginning , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what &apos;s going to do . </s>
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> . </s>
but wait , you know , this is really my <unk> . </s>
it &apos;s a hummer in which fear is in darkness . </s>
for this <unk> , <unk> veterans had another material , electronics became a more material . </s>
and we want to do this material for all available . </s>
so , is <unk> <unk> . </s>
you can go on the website , all the <unk> and they make themselves . </s>
we want to be the world , the inventor , the <unk> , because this world we live in , these kinds of things , we heard . </s>
so they pull off and start to invent it . </s>
thank you . </s>
