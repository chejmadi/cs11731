Allow me on this occasion of the Joint Sitting of Parliament for the annual debate on our state, to wish all the Honourable Members of Parliament a full year.
And I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most important year in our democracy, as we all realise the challenge of our people to realise the better life of all I have said this, as we have had our government delivered today, as we had no impact on our country's poor.
This today, in the presence of my day, Epainette Mbeki, MaMokeng, who has taken a significant message from the Jewish, she said that she was ready for many years, she said.
I would also like to take this opportunity to develop the President President Nelson Mandela Barko, one of the parents of democracy, who will mark his birth of 18 July this year.
We welcome Mr President Arth Anthur Margeman, who represents the beneficiaries of the Alexandra who never loved for trees to the past five years, including the Nelson Mandela Brick, who was honest with the honour.
We are also pleased to be honoured to be between us with Mr Bl. Dansizwe Sobu, his family, the leader of the Peobbu Union, who was born over the last 30 years.
All those who are honoured, representing mental and trust, and we are reminded by their presence that our work is a relatively rehabilitating the challenge of rehabilitation that the realisation of a better life for all of all South Africans.
We now want to begin the end of this financial year with the third democratic parliament and government soon after the commencement of the State of the Nation Address.
I am pleased to say that we are truly confident that we have put our commitment to the promise of the people in 2004., it is unclear, that we have done much to do about this.
Given that we are approaching our last era, Government has decided to find out the Priorities in which it will focus specially, using this as it means to speed up the process of reaching its people.
Happily, this State of the Nation Address provides me an opportunity to report to Parliament and the Nation General Requirements for Members, honourable Members can find on the Government website at the next week.
To recognise the Priorities means that all three spheres of government, national government, regional and local government, leadership and governance, ensure that they use the short term that is utilised to promote a better life for all our people.
The whole process of our government has committed ourselves that in the past, will make it compulsory - decision-making - Business Unusual transforming the Public Service and Unusual!
To ensure that this happens; we have taken appropriate steps to ensure that the Annual Budget for the Minister of Finance will give you an expiry of the month, which must provide the criteria for the implementation of the Apex Priorities.
More than many times, the situation confronts our country, and employment we have set ourselves, demand that we push and promote all our people to act together, together to do all the necessary things, together to do all of our future, together with all of us!
As we work together everywhere in our country, this should be understand that it must be us - Business Unusual!
When I prepare this Address, one among us suggested that our country is being engaged in a spirit that we can make it difficult to take place where our country is tomorrow.
He suggested that, to capture what she said the reality of this morning, I should remember the most common words Charles Charles Dick open his novel, Ale Change.
It was good time, it was a difficult period, not the age of wisdom, it was a pillar, healing of believed that we were all the festive season, healing of believed in the festive season, healing season, with sometimes believed to be a high time, with a sleever of our festimism.
You will ask if I fully agree with this assessment, if I believe if we have entered an era of joined time, which all of us must not lose sight, realistic and unarmedy!
My answer to this question is that No, Like the Government of our country and hope that the foundation has been done to continuously over the past 14 years to ensure that the better life of all our people will be better than we all.
However, like all honourable Members, I know that many of our people are concerned about the lack of settlement where our country will tomorrow.
They are concerned about the matter of urgency that the country is prevailing unhealthy electricity supply.
They are concerned about some developments in our economy, especially the rise of speedy growth, food and fuel prices which stress the poorest of our economy, which is the impact of our economy to transform the economy of our economy.
They worried about whether we have the capacity to defend democratic rights and the democratic Constitution enshrined by the law.
They complain about whether our country has a crime in the past six months.
As they know and respect the unions that governs its affairs, they must continue to contribute to democratic values, non-racial, non-sexist and non-sexist South African racism.
Clearly, it would be untoubtedly untoubtedly not be underestimate that some of these concerns or reject the boundaries of our country, as the poorest majority of our people in our country, is only one that we have given to respond to the slightly to our people in our country.
Let me say that this historical moment demand that our country has come a long and encouraging long-term and co-operation to address the challenges of our unions and caring it depends on our nation as a caring on our nation.
The matter of urgency of the country represented by redistribution of existing power outages challenge and the rest of the country to give a strong view to the call that we have all made to realise that the realisation of our country is realistic and that it is realistic.
In this regard, I would like to acknowledge and acknowledge as accompanying the comments made by the Chief Executive of Anglo American Asia, Cynarrill, when addressing the Mining in Cape Town, in the beginning of the course of this week, on Tuesday, in Cape Town, on the beginning of the course of this week, on the beginning of the beginning of the course of the course of the year, in the course of next rouesday, in Cape Town, on the course of the course of this week, in the course of the course of the launch, in the launch of the launch of this year, on the first rouesday, in the launch of the first rouesday, on the launch of the launch of the Town, on the first rouesday, on the first rouesday, in the launch of the launch of the Cape Town, on the launch of the launch of the launch of the
As the Honourable Members know, she said: I don't regard the problems of electricity supply as a disastrous South African environment: there are pressure on supply regarding the projects with Brazil.
It is, in fact, that it is incorre; overcome will require commitment, especially in energy efficiency, as well as creating alternative electricity supply for all, we will win, win, and I will win the win the win-win-win-win-win-win-win goal.
This was said, however, also important that we take this opportunity to refer to the country being asked to Government and Eskom to the problems that we have done experiencing the implications of both fire and I wish to thank all those citizens.
In the past two weeks, the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have tabled an emergency structure that we face with every one of us had to do it in this regard to restore the Honour.
In reality, the extension of electricity demand for the past two years has grown the new era of the situation that resulted in the delivery of the internal market has been impacted in a long way, and it is not been unequal.
As government our work is to lead and coordinate the country's drive to save electricity for the challenge.
There is a strong mobilisation for everyone, any family and business that can be produced by the Ministry of Minerals and there are proposals for your community, and they will also share it.
Government will begin to launch the campaign to ensure a fair share of water, hygiene and straight management in households in households, including housing standards that are able to take care of electricity for all households with immediate electricity.
The directive has been given to all government buildings to reduce the use of electricity and you will not disappear the names of those who do not.
Details of some voluntary steps on the Independent Power Conservation Programme were set by the Ministers and this will be dealt with in consultation with the participants after being published.
On the supply side Eskom has the power to ensure sustainability of effective co-operation projects. We take steps to ensure the strengthening of Eskom's energy efficiency and the efficiency of coal and coal working with all the necessary measures to improve the efficiency of coal and efficiency of energy and efficiency.
The programme of the Eskom's drive to build new entrepreneurs and the ABan's Supply Chain Agency, as well as the General Departments committed to providing more efficient, with the Department of Ministerial Supply Chair, with the Department of Minerals and Energy in South Africa.
I want to thank mining in the way they have helped us and the economy to resolve the disaster affected by 24 January and We will work to reduce the impact of this industry.
An integrated approach and consultation with the Local Government plays an opportunity to respond to both immediate Minster and Ultimately Posits through the National Energy Security Agency, which supports the National Energy and Energy Strategies of both the National Energy and Energy and Energy and Energy Strategies.
I will invite a meeting of the Joint Sitting of the Presidency to coordinate all our efforts and we will announce the first ever-term team of Eligius's constitution that will help us to address the challenges of the South African government and to help them.
The Minister of Finance will provide more information on the Budget Review report on the support that will be provided by Government in the electricity and home-based electricity drive to build infrastructure programmes.
We face a disastrous but we can overcome the problems in the situation that led to the reality that ineffective and sustainable electricity has been realised to the end of the short-term capacity of our economy.
We therefore have a country with economic imperatives. We must support the mining industry. It is inevitable that while continuing the way in which the country, we will also continue to sustain the support of the economy.
So let us use this emergency to put things, the first steps to save electricity for the future we must not avoid Authentication that all hands in order to resolve the dangerous, which we have put together with our approach!
This is a uniform approach that we should take as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Soccer Review Confederations Cup in 2009 and the New Soccer Review which will begin in our country.
In reality, I have no doubt that we will reach to accommodate this undertaking to FIFA and the world community of our commuter and create all necessary conditions for the best ever of the best ever of the World Cup.
And the issue we are receiving, in all areas of the South African community and far, represented by the day's progress and the day we are making in all our preparations, is one of Business Unusual!
We do not know that the key element of our preparations should be a team of a team of a team of South African team who will be proud and the rest of the world, as well as the African Union of our football Socco-beier, and the South African Union.
We also acknowledge Sp Springboks as they won the Rugby World Cup last year.
I now want to talk about the Priorities I have mentioned.
To further accelerate the economic growth of our economy and development and we will implement the Expanded Public Process Plan. Government will continue industrial programmes to deal with further entrepreneurship and create more effective and R25 billion in this regard to industrial policy.
Working together with business and labour, we will also develop as urgently as possible, industrial plans in sectors where such plans do not exist, mining and mineral beneficiation, agriculture, as mining and minerals, utilizerals and support.
In addition, I want to ensure that we remain committed to support the automotive sector and we ensure support the support given by the sector through the South African Police Service (Mofficacy is maintained.
In the small sector, we will continue to maintain the fiscal state that supports continuing economic growth and reduction in external and external costs.
To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will complement the development of a infrastructure integrated infrastructure development plan, there is an impact on sustainable energy infrastructure programme, promote state-owned and Expanded Public Worterprises and expand infrastructure programmes, including more effective technologies and technologies and technologies, as well as all areas of networks.
The participation in rural plans, and the key events are information and communication technologies such as the co-ordinate and co-ordination team in its area where necessary, this year we have now finalised the issues of the local authority, as the Solilet and the sector.
At the same time, we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50% in the end of this year. and will be the process of industrialisation in South Africa, which is to be completed by the year.
Recognition that this delay applications for investment in respect of issues such as land restitution, infrastructure and environmental impact assessment that will result in all developments or damaging them in the spirit of Business Unusual, as soon as possible, we have taken off course.
The Qualitative Priorities of government will focus on the issues of competent development. The Expanded Public Works Strategy will be completed this year, which will be intensified in the Public Skills Acquisition, strengthened and co-ordinated programmes (GIP) and co-ordinated to monitor and strengthened.
In reality, we are encouraged by positive results from the private sector expressed by the decade of 70 companies that have been set out in Johannesburg and the government's ability to address the challenge.
In addition to this task in the future, we will prioritise interventions in FET colleges, SETAs, infrastructure in three-pronged schools and cost-effective schools, and speed up the training of professional graduates.
Furthermore, the labilisation of weaknesses in the programme of Basic Education, identified last year, the month we will launch the Kha Ri Gude mass literacy campaign (includudududucators) mass literacy training transducators.
Between economic programmes, and it deserves to be, it is an acknowledgement that advances the quality of life of all South Africans, acting as an important weapon to reach a goal of speed up the goal of all.
In the programme to provide human settlements, we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum, and agreement reached SALGA and to set a decision to settle the land on housing programme.
Together with the progress we are making in various interventions focused on poverty reduction, we continue to address the number remaining weaknesses, including the implementation of the Land Use Management Bill, to finalise the support of land reform and the implementation of Land Reform, including the implementation of Land Reform and the programme.
These are some of the issues we have to take this year, and ensure that we achieve the goals we have set ourselves.
Another Value is to define and understanding of the process of fighting poverty, especially the most affected people affected by this problem, including children, women, young people living in urbanisation, rural and urbanisation.
Among the proposed machinery: the programme of government's work programme, employment incentives to create work-related groups, to strengthen the capacity of women, to empower and improve the interaction and improve the quality of education and training, and training in poor communities, to improve the participation of poverty and support of all sectors.
With regard to this initiative is a special project to assess the interventions required to deal with children under the age of 14 years.
But we all agree that the community and the poor in particular, they will not allow for co-ordinated and subsequent education - rather than likely to be necessary.
In this regard, we will require National Aramaments to the battle Against Poverty to coordinate government departments such as the Local Government, Trade and Industry, Agriculture, Forestry and Land Reforms, as well as the Department of Health and Rural Development and Land Reform, as well as the interventions necessary.
This year we will focus on the most important needs in fighting poverty in the country, we urge the inclusion of the social economy.
to promote the National Youth Service Programme including the rise of qualified people who are recognised in the National Defence Force for South African Defence Force from now 45 000.
To ensure that the Expanded Public Works Programme, highly stable, it has proved to be limited to more people: this will involve a number of young people in the programme, over 6 000 young people in the implementation of government.
We will also integrate the programme to speed up sustainable human settlements development, and intensified efforts, as a matter of urgency, speed up access, sanitation, electricity and sanitation, so that we have to reach all areas and services.
To speed up this commitment to health goal for all of us to ensure the implementation of the National HIV Strategy and AIDS Strategy (IW) we aim to ensure that the goal of health of health in all those who are not taken up to train 7,7% of the people who are not taken to train 7,7% of TB and treatment for treatment for more than 7%.
We aim to complete the work in a comprehensive social security system, benefiting from the consultations established by social partners.
Two points need to be briefly mentioned.
The first of these is the suggestion that we must swear that we will be congratulated learners and morning on the week, as well as the Youth League to showcase their lives of all the people in South Africa.
The second issue is geographic and its names, which requires a process of adhering to all provinces so that we can develop a fundamental change that we propose to implement the process that will soon be supported by the South African Geographical Names Council.
When we refer to the issue of crime in the last year, we all worried violent crime, but also for example that things have resulted in the past decline - it will be found to deepening democracy.
Accordingly, last year we engaged in business and other sectors of society, to develop a better approach to the restructuring of justice system.
In this regard, by spirit of Business Unusual, Cabinet agreed on the necessary change for the new judiciary, this approach to transforming the judiciary and transforming Police into any form of jurisdiction, including the nature of the judiciary, including the judiciary and transforming of the judiciary, the jurisdiction of the Legislature, including the judiciary and transforming Police into any other functionaldidiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the judici
As the Honourable Members have the foundation, some of these initiatives were initiated; we have hope that if everything has been done in a constructive and integrated manner, which will be more effective, the Minister will be committed to Crime Prevention.
In the course of this year, we will also launch Bills on the transformation of justice by consultation with the judges of the Magistrates, concluding the process aimed at strengthening cross border control and security, also given to the rights, and the Bill of Rights, in particular.
This is advisable by a resolution to intensify the fight against crime, as well as recommendations of the Khampepe Justice Commission on the performance of the Directorate of Special Operating Commission, which aims to improve the effectiveness of the Criminal Justice and enhance the effectiveness of this year.
This will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve governance, coordination and law enforcement agencies.
More importantly, our achievements on the day and crime depends on co-operation among us as citizens of law, inspires the rule of law, respect for the judiciary and the rights of our democracy, and in line with our Constitution.
This year we will continue efforts to improve government's performance so that we can reach citizens' obligations. When doing something, the spirit of Business Unusual will be served to the public servants.
There are simple but urgent and critical things we need to do, as part of the overall efforts to improve the capacity of the government.
Firstly, it has been agreed on all government structures so that, especially the key role players will be completed in six months, with the Department of Public Service and Administration will shape the process of monitoring these decisions.
Secondly, by May of every year (and in the beginning of the financial year in the local government) all senior managers must submit Key Performance Agreements with relevant government managers to monitor the implementation of the relevant government system.
Thirdly, recognising that the Department of Home Affairs is the cornerstone of every citizen's life annually, and we will intensify the implementation of the transformation process adopted by Cabinet as well as the ITID approach to alleviate the process of newly.
Improve performance in the public service also depends on the importance of leadership given by the administration and leadership of Executive, it is important to improve public servants in their workplace - which is directors, managers and civil union leaders.
In this regard, this year, in partnership with trade union organisations, we will call the Government Gazette to discuss issues that the spirit of Batho Pele has expressed strong views where government services are provided.
Working together with other social partners, we will ensure that, at the end of this year, the National Anti-corruption Programme is adopted, and that the agreed strategy is implemented with the local government department will establish mechanisms.
This year we will continue to strengthen efforts and capacity in the local government to correspond to the Local Government Agency 5-year-old Development Agenda. To ensure that the monitoring and evaluation of the SALGA has agreed to provide reports on the mandate.
In order to further to improve the services provided by sectors such as veterans' roots, women and youth, we will review the institutions set up to perform the necessary and monitor the necessary, including the evaluation of the government's youth development and to monitor the implementation of the government's priority.
Many challenges in our work that we have gained from weaknesses in planning., as part of our Quality Apex Priorities in the coming period ahead, which will enable government to improve government's effectiveness and efficiency.
This programme we can also outline is the commitment that our country has agreed to the leadership of the continent through the New Growth Path in Africa.
An important issue, in increasing the African Agenda this year, will be strengthening the African institutions, including the African Union and development programme, NEPAD.
This will enable us to do, encouraged by the common interests of the peoples of the continent to meet the country's agreement across all areas of Action in this regard is to collect the institutions and gathering activities in these areas.
We continue to be committed to the free trade area in the Southern African Development Community, and hope that the use of the SADC chairperson of 2008 / 029 will provide an impact on this matter.
In this regard, we will continue to engage with our partners and the European Union, on the issue of the African Union, to ensure that the negotiations in the Economic Partners are concluded with our Conference.
During the past year, we have convey our mandate of SADC to assist in the leadership of Zimbabwe's political leadership to find a solution to the challenges they face.
In short, the parties involved in discussions have reached an agreement on all matters relating to the parties must organise the matters relating to the Constitution, broadcasters and other relevant legislation, the election of the legislature, the subject to the matters, the subject to the new Constitution.
Accordingly, we will be celebrating together with the United Nations Leaders of State and Government in congratulating two parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue in which they have achieved and motivated to work together to resolve the remaining side of the African Union.
Our relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue, as we need to participate in the country's efforts to achieve peace and order to implement their development programme.
We are concerned about the violence and killing in Kenya and Chad, which has made progress over the past few years of renewals about the revitalization of all South Africans, helping all of us to do everything.
In fact, we will continue to make our contribution to the United Nations Security Council.
Inspired by the need to promote the improvement of the quality of life for all individuals, especially in the developing countries, we will focus on strengthening our participation in the strengthening of the India-Asia, the New Partnership of the India-Asia, and the African Union-Asia-Asia-Africa trade negotiations.
Similarly, we will continue to contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and continuing improvements in this regard, and gives perceptions to the WTO negotiations.
This year we celebrate a tenthly celebrating a diplomatic relations between South Africa and the People's Republic. China. Growth in many areas within our society and ensure that the Partnership of the Partnership and the Partnership for South Africa is a better partnership.
Next year, we will host the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the International Conference Against Racism which was held in 2001. and that we continue to re-affirm that the outcome of our people will continue to realigne the racism and ensure that we continue to re-affirm our society.
This global responsibility, including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, will lead to relief of confidence that we have in the country as a good way in all these efforts are underestimate.
I am confident that, under the leadership of the International Marketing Council, Trade and Investment South Africa (TISA), Tourism South Africa and other agencies, we will be commemorating the rest of the world's globalisation of our people in the rest of the world.
Having said what I have said, I come back to the question: what is our country when we begin!
What I know and say is: what challenges we have now, are fighting!
I say what I have felt, because I have confidence that South Africans are capable and committed to real historic challenge - to emphasise each of the past four years - including in our country's economic and social challenges, with regard to the challenges of our country, with regard to the past four years, and in our country.
While we are embrassed, and committed to managing our business in a more unusual, we will ensure the process of restructuring and sustainable development and beyond higher levels.

It is a pleasure to speak before the Joint Sitting of Parliament of Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, at the beginning of the last part of our first philosophy of our Democratic Parliament.
I am waiting for the people of South Africa with humility over the period that I have had a high level of trafficking in the country's abuser prevailing democracy from the previous State led by the former President.
For me it is a responsibility, on the issue of a few months, to lead the National Council of Provinces to finalise the mandate of the National Congress in 2004, and to laid the basis behind the election process.
That for the past five months, we have been able to ensure that there are untoubted changes in the administration of our government as a result of our past five years of our democratic and co-operation of the Executive Council.
Looking back over the past decade, I would like to acknowledge and harder of President Thabo Hbe and Mbeki and many women play under the leadership of the African Union; to play a role in the leading of all three major role in the South African continent.
In all of this, I stand by celebrating all of you, with confidence that South Africa we celebrate today - the world has been divided, problems and experienced in the past 15 years - and the result of South African women and men.
South Africans representing belief and openness that is the characteristics of our country.
In them, I wish to extend the Ms Helen Suzman, a special South African, representing the values of our new Parliament in the previous lies.
We also need some of those whose homes sharing friends to be served as we know that we have no economic profile, even if we are visiting political change in our country.
However, we should not underestimate the challenges we face. Focusing of the world economy to create high-risk poverty for inequality and social groups in our society.
Naturally, there is a lack of political alliance may cause many questions that do not have answers to the present.
For that reason, some of us can be surprising vibo-economic heritage and will boost our approach to the economic crisis.
But our country is a journey of confidence and selfity.
We may say, in the unusual situation, many of our Constitution have lagotten in the moment; and all of this examination indicates democracy.
Our democracy is healthy. Newly sustainable, is underestimated by the Constitution that has not been aligned to the world.
In reality, hard work in our discussions during the era of democracy - which we all agreed that we must have a democracy and freedom - is a promise to enhance democracy and democracy.
It is the people of South Africa that can guarantee continuity; and we will also defend our democracy in the coming years.
Allow me, Madam Speaker and Chairperson, for the purposes of appeal to all South Africans who have to register and vote in the next two regional and regional elections, so that we can shape our own future.
This we must do every day working at municipal offices, before the election of the voters'll.
I want to take time when I took out that in the next few days, I will conclude with the Judiciary and the Presidential Youth Commission, to inform the day of the elections.
We extend our gratitude as democracy to all South Africans, in April 1994, to all of us all take their future into our hands.
It is an easy task but the importance of opting for the people of our country, we have pointed out demands for all our humanity.
It is therefore necessary to celebrate the celebration of 20 Years of approval of the Ordinary Ordinary Committee on the South African Qualifications which was adopted in August 1989, as set out.
Strategies have made the basis for the global agreement, with the International Union, in particular discussions in South Africa.
In South Africa, it also has also made a conversent of the 1989 Conference of Democratic Future - to integrate various social partners.
All this led to the negotiations in our first democratic election in 1994.
In this regard, we must show the honour to the President of the African National Congress, Oliver Reliver Tambo, initiated this throughout the country and the international community, with international debt of our country.
That process of engagement is a framework for peacekeeping and reconciliation, in the and conflict, resulted in a positive and bad and worstruction in the past 160 Conference of the United Nations (NRC).
If the Conference defined the borders of the South African values we know today, it is not placed under apartheid and separated.
So, 15 years in our democracy, we can begin to review the fear, unambiguous and uncertainties over 100 years of distinguish between our democracy, and alleviate the abuse of some women, but it is not only be a pity.
In this respect and the lack of protection has given the rise of a year of proud.
Solomon Mahlangu was continuing the trend of the past five years, who saw the under Germs Chryodium 187 who came to win the struggle against our own democracy.
Thirteen years of friends and twelve to continue, we can respond to the conviction that has been made in those areas.
Between education, mutual respect, the common interest in many young people falling during the struggle to trafficking the dawn of freedom and leaders of adult.
A student group from the NUSAS to begin the South African Student Association (Sool) 40 years ago.
In this regard, we also honour the Ephra Ephra Ephrage President Mogale, the first 30 years of the South African Student Association (CA), and his peer.
By rememorating the student of yesterday there is a message that was rejected, that the legitimate of freedom and experience even though our youth.
The epidemic in their holistically enthusiasm cease today as it was the past few years, that we should lead to a leading the spirit of Freedom Charter (F).
We invite these organisations and its leaders to emphasize the spirit of believing and affirming democracy in fighting liberation while all these obstacles are uncertain; unevable; the responsibility that our expression in many perspectives.
And so, Madam Speaker and Chairperson of the Honourable Chairperson, we must ask ourselves: what steps have been described in transforming the democratic Constitution of the Republic of South Africa for the past five years of our democracy;
Today we have a democratic system that serves, which is placed in the principles of transparency, and multilateral institutions to engage with citizens and institutions supporting the democratic Constitution.
Over the past decade, we have improved the levels of management by young people. We have improved the system of government communication in all spheres of government, improved coordination and its interaction.
Indeed, government can be proud that we have changed the nature of government's performance, which relate to our national features.
However, while women do about 34% of higher levels in public employment, which is under the equity that we had set.
At the national level and provincial legislatures, for instance, it is that the national government will be more than 32% women representation at the level to 2004 and hope that 40% of the local government elections.
We hope that all political parties, while completing its election, will participate in these good initiatives!
With the progress they have been made, 0,2%, the situation is particularly unsatisfied by the disabled to be employed in government, comparisoning 2% that we have set ourselves.
To count on all of us, the private sector remains behind.
Specific proposals have been set to improve the effectiveness of the public service, including the financial management, Centres and other Thusong, to improve the performance of government, and to improve governance of the Departments.
However, there is still much more needs to be done to improve the service and to educate performance in some public servants, especially those who are faces with citizens in their public service.
As the Honourable Members know, our government has prioritised corruption as a major objective.
This enshrined in the principles and regulatory regulating public servants and politicians who have arrest intergovernmental relations, social and social partners, as well as telephone lines of corruption.
It may be that maladministration and alleviation of corruption is lacking; but from the perspective of government, we can say that over 70% of the Criminal actions reported to the public because government has acquired alcohol and corruption.
Such challenges exist in the private sector, the challenge is under control; there is a matter of enforcement.
I know that we all agreed to a better life for our citizens, especially in this country can generate the generation of national wealth and ensure that the benefits of all the economy are divided.
It is normally, after economic stagnation in the 1980s and 1990, South Africa has grown substantially economic growth since 1994.
During the first decade of Freedom, the economic growth of average of 3% per annum, and the improvement of 5% in 2004 to 5% in 2007.
While increasing employment, employment and income price increase, income levels, employment and social wage, it has taken a leading to sustainable growth opportunities.
This includes, at the beginning, the high rate of investment and private sector investment, over the past five years, we had invested in the Gross GDP (GDP).
This is part of government's programme results to expand public infrastructure.
It is a result of the policies to improve the level of investment in the private sector; and to make a fiscal policy more realising employment and reduce the impact of inflation while promoting economic and social sustainability.
The aim of the larger economic transformation over the past decade, and efforts, especially from 2004 was removed from obstacles to sustainable growth.
In this regard, efforts to Shalose Growth and Shared Growth and Shared (ASA) initiative), ensure that all obstacles to sustainable infrastructure such as infrastructure, policy, is the challenge of effective implementation, coordination and effective programmes, and the challenge of government.
Our economy is open, and since 1994 is stabilised in our global financial system.
But, its accessibility to the residents of our society is still under the expectations of our economy, our global trade and foreign trade, particularly the sector of growth, particularly the sector.
Because of this, the rate of globalisation and international trade has not been ratioled with other countries.
And because of the weaker savings rate, we have had a lack of financial impact on investment programmes.
These are the challenges our country will face to continue.
More importantly, is the question: what is the economic growth of the Treatment to be done to improve the lives of people?
Therefore, the question is whether other growth remains balance and unity can face the economy.
More importantly, sharing the benefits of growth must include the labour force, ensuring fair employment.
It is, in fact, a question of salt that between 1995 and 2003, the economy created about millions of new jobs; and at least 500 per annum between 2004 and the year and only half of 000 jobs between 2004 and the year.
At the last time, it is the first step since the gain of democracy, creating more than the first unemployment rate, which has reduced unemployment rate from 31% in 2007.
It is true, this should not remove our promises to continue to review the issue of employment equity, including the rights and benefits they can enjoy.
To share the benefits of growth including the launch of the employment redress employment reforms were excluded, including Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment.
This is not in line with the racial agenda, in fact, unsounded country's participation at all levels of economic activity that will work high.
The fact that the private sector is lagging behind the state of regulatory and capacity, in business development and other sectors in our country to grow.
To share the benefits of growth means sustainable employment and equity in government through public disposal and sharing the burden of public service delivery.
Nonetheless, honour members will know that more data on the issue related to the wage of civil society, I will mention some examples of the natural resource progress we have experienced.
Government is aware that there is growing poverty in our country; and the level of inequality is high.
Over the past 15 years we have done much better than we can attack this by providing social assistance.
Firstly, the level of income poverty alleviation from poverty alleviation while alleviating alleviation of poverty eradication of poverty, inequality has increased significantly while alleviation of poverty alleviation while alleviation of poverty alleviation while alleviation of poverty alleviation of poverty alleviation while alleviation of poverty alleviation while alleviation of poverty alleviation as permits has increased significantly relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly significantly poorly poorly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly decline.
In the households that include children (incluined as aged 17 and 17), the proportion of households reported that children under the age of poverty has declined significantly significantly toperive poverty from 31 percent (including over the age of 55 percent in 2006.) have improved the poor.
In reality, this view is tiyisisiwafied by our research, which shows that the millions of South African citizens and Coloureds have declined, resulted in the result of 2008, the amount of job seekers have increased to reach a total of 125 million in 1994.
This happens because of the Promotion of Access to Child Assistance, rising from 34 million beneficiaries in 2008.
As part of providing poor salaries, the target rate of unemployment by the Expanded Public Works Programme was achieved in 2008, the year before the commencement of the programme had taken place since 2004.
In the issue of access to basic services by households, the number of speaks for themselves.g. access to water has improved from 62% in 1996 to 88% in 2008 and 78% in electricity; (5% to 72% in electricity; (5% to 72%).
Evaluating the income of the country's earnings best to improve access to health facilities. 95% of South African people live in 54 kilometres of water and all households have increased access to the quality of water and has increased from 85% of the nursetre; and all the nutrition has increased.
It also gives us emphasis that HIV research shows falling and decline in the infection rate.
In addition, the treatment of anti anti anti anti anti anti anti anti antiretroviral programme was only high in the world, but increased during treatment, over 60 000 patients had begun.
But health facilities do not have always medicines, and enough staff, and the provision of water and electricity. For other resources, the management is untrutably stable with opinion to be improved.
In education, we see the underverage teacher performance and a student; a full achievement by school enrolment at school level; and better than the number of children passing meat and nutrition.
Of course we know that there are those who leave school and classrooms and higher schools, which is not acceptable, and the education system has not yet produced the necessary skills.
In addition, the process of performance, all in terms of composition and learning, highlighting the matter of concern for the past.
Sadly, where education is much needed to help eradicate poverty, with limited resources, management and number of teachers.
Special programmes of government in its citizens have also been built to assist poor, for housing have been allocated 2,6 million.
We must acknowledge that the issue of land reform programme as well as stabilisation after new accommodation should be made soon as reasonably possible.
In general, we are proud of the continuity of social programmes.
In education, health, housing, sanitation, water and sanitation, the most important question we face is where we can improve the quality of these work materials!
The violent crime is still a source of lack of protection for South Africans, Experience and daily, on poverty and inequality such as poverty, etc in a negative attack.
In the organization of state and the private sector, bad alleviate Schemes is a matter of concern.
It is true, the total proportion of crime, which is based on 2002, has grown down all Stats stated in this.
But we know that this decline has not grown rapidly, and almost 7-10% that we have set ourselves in crime levels, that the violent crime is that the violent violent crime and violently violently violently violently violent crime;
This indicates the lack of power in our areas, especially in the building of technical and we will assist in resolving crime and showcase criminal justice system, to investigate the effectiveness of crime and efficiency of all our police institutions.
These are matters which criminal justice system can commence and preparing it.
But, when we are alcohol, we should not lose the fact that we review the current procedure, which is illegranted by our country.
This is a matter that these changes exist in these organisations, in terms of its basic values and principles to the culture of human rights, its structure and its administration.
But let us not condemn: as our whole lives, that amendment is still in the early stage.
I know that honourable Members will agree with me that in our democratic moment we have to find a meaningful expectations where we are looking at vulnerable.
In this regard, by international law, international law, control and tourists confirmed efforts to improve children's conditions, women and old.
Thanks to campaigns and the outcome of our partnerships we have gained partnership and institutions representing marginalised groups, we have improved the impact on this matter; and encourage the development of the priority.
It is a matter of record of pride, for example, families, priority by women have received a high level of social assistance including housing and health care; and to programmes that are successfully planned for the development of nutrition and well-being of children.
But to achieve high unemployment in rural women, young people and HIV infantly affects young women and children and higher.
All these work has been allocated for the future.
These are some of the signs that have been brought by democracy; and the success of government has made available to meet the electoral mandate.
There is no objection that, with measuring, progress has been made since 1994 no surprise that there are no doubt that these challenges are still many.
But I have gone a long journey for freedom. I did not succeed; I have taken a long journey, as I have got that I got that I had a long shock, as I have got there.
In some months now people will announce the leadership they would like to continue this good work of a vibrant and other people have begun our democracy.
While our global perceptions are different, the goals we have seen obviously where it can be enshrined in our Constitution: creating a prosperous, non-racial, non-sexist democratic, non-racial and non-sexist democratic society.
Six years ago, our people joined our Summit to Peace and Development Summit and agreed on the work we have to do to improve the lives of South Africans, especially to alleviate poverty and reduce poverty by 2014.
to promote equity, development, economic and social development, economic development and social development; and home action to implement development, including the conditions of infrastructure and access to basic services.
I believe that, as part of this, the goals in which South Africa depends on the improvement of education; adequate provision of health care, well-being; strengthening rural development and social security; to ensure a better nutrition; and strengthening rural and social security;
I quote these issues because they are empowered or familiarising or will make it all national police civic society, I have chosen to make such a matter of emphasis that South Africans are not suffering our view to transform the poor.
This perspectives are accompanied by all human, in which highlighted in the Millennium Development Goals.
Again, today it is faced with a risk that the objectives set out in the recent years, if not the age of age, it is the result of the economy attacks the whole economy.
What, then, is the first financial crisis in the non-profit organisations, and the price for products and trade.
We can restructuring, well-being of senior managers, i.e. we can relocate government policies that will take place at the cost of their journey and allows for unauthorised markets.
But our mid-term work is to acknowledge the outcome of these developments in our country and country's economy, there will also show their impact on these areas in our society.
This is why our country's regulatory environment and stadium policy policies that we have to help stop this negative impact.
But we all know that, due to the global economic integration, and the need for international trade and employment, to achieve finance and financial incentives that have been transformed into unjust economic growth; and
These difficulties are accompanied during inflation and interest rates are high.
Consequently, the development of this fund that we need to expand infrastructure provision and implementation of our infrastructure projects.
We know with us that South Africa is relatively small, compared with other countries, at the time of the economy of South Africa's economy, and the country's lowest growing economy, even if the lowest growth rate.
In this respect, honourable Members, I am happy to report that in consultation with the Presidency and the leaders of different stakeholders, we have agreed to integrate the social partners that will reduce our emphasis.
Firstly, government will continue with government's investment projects, the value of this increase to R90 billion over the next three years, where necessary, we will recover money.
This will include support through financial and monetary union institutions to come from the international agency, with a partnership with the private sector and resources that regulates such as pension.
Secondly, we will intensify employment programmes in some sectors, we plan to increase employment equity in such as health, labour, social workers and the Expanded Public Works Programme, and further to speed up the following Expanded Public Works.
Thirdly, legal steps can be implemented in the private sector to underestimate higher investment and liquidation or industrial liquidation.
On its part, government will implement industrial finance and the instrument to assist with the challenges in different sectors, and encourage the development of industries to help sharing these industries.
Together it can help, it is a long-term holidays, increasing training, short-term work.
Fourthly, government will undertake and expanding the expenditure of the nation, including increased access to child grant for 18 and reducing the age of social grant for 60 years.
In addition, we will intensify the Expanded Public Works Programme (No Reb Consumption) and the price of food security especially those who are victims of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
We will continue to focus on the challenges of negotiating misconduct for some business in this way, we wish to thank the Competition Commission showing that they will be held.
We hope that the social union will continue to strive for this and ensure, in some, that the price is understood by society.
These measures will comply with the revolutionary policy, we will ensure that the levels of borrowing is careful and encouraging that there is also reduction of government's debates.
Our efforts will comply with measurable standards to protect and improve the impact of climate change that caused on unemployment.
All parties of the G20 and consultation union organisations, our government wants to engage in an underestimate world when the emphasis has begun to ensure that the provision of financial and sustainable financial management is necessary; and
More importantly, we must protect our values in international trade union management, complete the International Trade Organisation negotiations, International trade union negotiations, and ensure that social development is underestimated.
Education that can be recognised in this experience that we need strong partnerships for stakeholders in the home and the global economic and social scale, not only the impact of the crisis; there will also reinvent the rates.
In our country, we will begin this as part of the nation's earnings commitment to high rates of growth and Unusual development, which will be prevailing to achieve a high level.
In this regard, what we have invested in our country will largerly invested in the country's labour force, it will be very important to engage in the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, as well as the Stadiums globalisation of our country's current tradiums globalisation of our country's globalisation and that has been completed.
We also hope that, after five years of win, the national football team has been ready to work more than we can!
But beyond that, this will result in a progressive and supplied and give routine to South Africa and to alcost human beings - transforming all our country's perspective and the rest of our country's globalisation!
We also wish to celebrate everything sports teams showing South African efforts over the past decade of congratulating the team to a high level of globalisation.
Also, with the best Rugan World Cup; Gini Horille Holder and his team winning Darrhoea R; Occoyi van did not carry out the best team of our people with a team of wedlock.
The past two weeks, South Africa has completed and the Money of saving the old Handbook documents.
This flow charcohol shows the leadership of Africa in science and literatures, trade and trade union, which will be entered into by slavery and take the South African property.
This programme encourages effective and other countries in our country and far from improving social
In reality, over the past 15 years we have tried to ensure that the South African experience reiterated that the country has to be on the South African Judan, and young people in our continent, to reiterate our country's interest.
It is this, and onlyly, that we can make our commitment to helping the people of Zimbabwe find a solution to that country's democracy.
It is necessary to mention the SADC Communication, President Thabo Mbeki and this group does not condemn the process and tolerate this process to conclude with decisions.
At the moment the country's work is very important; and South Africa will help you where possible.
We also also urge that, even if it comes to the success of the People of Democratic Republic of Congo on their road to sustainable and sustainable development.
This collaboration can be built at the moment between the DRC and the Randa to hold their promises to continue the issue of security and the issue of social security, but also at the Company's Union, as well as the Stadium, and the support of the Stadium.
In this regard it may seem to be present in various developments over the past few months, South Africa will use the SADC's seats to strengthen the maintained of the country's Union, in particular to ensure the globalisation of bilateral Summit.
At the same time, we will improve the co-operation of SADC and the International Occupational Occupational Occupational Ter Protocols (CACA) that will be regarded to enhance the relationship with the South African Revenue Service (SAPSU).
We should like to congratulate people and Zambian Leadership, Ghana and the United States showing peace to their countries.
We will always need to strengthen relations with other countries with show social.
We have a privileged that this year we have concluded celebrating the first ten years of diplomatic cooperation and the country's diplomatic partnership.
We have given our full view to the Middle East and the Israel and Palestinian. Francansion and violation of this struggle for life, especially for the people, including children, women and children and old, describes.
This process of attacking is unnecessary.
We congratulate the government and the people of Cuba in celebrating 50 years of freedom and freedom, freedom of movement for development.
We have been able to eradicate negotiations on the European Union in our country's initial efforts to conclude the International Economic and regional economic relations.
We look forward to continuing to strengthen relations when we host the South African AU Summit in September this year.
Together with other countries of the Republic of South Africa will continue to strengthen the objective of the International Organisation, the International Fund and telecommunications to showcase the institutions and transform the democratic system.
We also committed to achieving the objectives of international agreements, including the Kyoto Protocol and who enshrines the future of our people and the international community.
This introduce our efforts are the two fundamental principles: our desire to complete the directive given by 2004; we want to ensure that the government will fill in the right platform.
In the coming months before the national and provincial elections, we shall try to finalise a common dance.
Emphasise the efforts to strengthen the justice system, to increase the proportion of R50, the National Youth Commission is ultimately use of information and communication, better coordination and governance structures that are specifically aligned to the National Assembly;
This is one of the programmes, including the Requirements for the Government Apex Priorities) mentioned in the State of the Nation Address, from the beginning of our initial dance to finalise the future.
We will ensure that our efforts are universified by diverse deaths, believing and sustainable people of South Africa in terms of which is good for all of us, and that the poor is realising that the quality of our health, is in our society.
And so, in the words of the former President President President Mandela, "Jhina is a slowd, because the [success is now at the expiry of the!
@ndac190061615005
On 22nd of April, millions of South Africans were out of choice. They have taken their right to be encouraged to alter their lives.
With their high rates, they have confirmed that working together we can do more to fight poverty and create better life for all.
They are encouraged by a vision of inclusive society, South Africa that belongs to all, a racial and unity among its citizens, working together to all of them.
We are very concerned about this electoral mandate given by the people of our country, who have chosen their government in a undoubtedly.
Our nation, in the past few years, has experienced a serious challenges.
In this regard, we have a strong and democratic functional of democracy, and institutions, that we have managed to overcome this difficulty with dignity and dignity.
Today's work is to celebrate what makes this democracy work. It also celebrates our culture for continuing and accountable collective responsibility.
This also has proof of the existence of our icon Madiba, who has laid the foundation for a nation, and the existence of President Thabo Mbeki, who built on that basis.
Further progress has also been made with the fact that former President Kgalema Motlanthe is now the Deputy President of the Republic, after many of this transition, and in many respects.
As you can be aware, the fight against poverty remains one of our focus.
We cannot, and we will never dwel ourselves, in our fight against poverty.
To achieve these goals, our government has chosen 10 priorities, which is part of the Germanent Strategic Framework for 2009 to 2014.
This programme is being initiated under difficult economic conditions.
The past year has saw the global economy over the past of the crisis has never been in the past decade.
While South Africa is not affected by this way the number of other countries affected, its present implications are increasingly seen in our economy, we have also affected the impact of the economy.
It is important now more than ever before we work together in the same programme to have a response to this crisis.
We regard as our first place of the South African response to the global economic crisis, which has been achieved by government, labour and business in February this year, we must take action to reduce the impact of the current vulnerable.
We have begun to work to reduce the loss of unemployment. There is consensus between government and state-owned enterprises to initiate the process of training.
These workers will be faced with dismissal as a result of the economic problems will be displayed in a particular time and the ability once again.
The discussion of the process of continuing interaction between people who work with these areas will be affected by this initiative, including the Sector Education and Training.
We will support the work of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to assist employers and workers to find otherwise without delay in terms of relevant legal procedures.
To date, CCMA commissioners have saved more than four thousand jobs through facilitation processes, and give advice and support workers who have been postponed.
The Small Enterprise Development Corporation has begun the programme to provide finance to the most vulnerable companies.
Building on the successes of our industrial policy interventions, the Industrial Policy Action Plan will be introduced.
Priority areas that have been selected are transport, chemicals, tourism, clothing and textiles, as well as forestry, and expansion, with regard to innovation, facilitation of innovation and innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation and development.
As part of Phase 2 of the Expanded Public Works Programme, the Public Works Programme will be speeded up.
It provides a minimum level of regular work to those who need, while improving the quality of life to the community.
Economic growth will affect the speed that our country can address the social and economic challenges our country faces.
The priorities that we have identified, and plans we put before the voters, remain at the heart of this government programme.
In the spirit of South African citizens, let us embrace our hands to find solutions to the time they come to work hard.
Our government will look forward, not later!
The steps outlined in our Medium Term Strategic Framework Strategic Framework must take into account which is maintained by the economic crisis, Decentralisation should not make these plans effective.
We decides that work together to speed up economic growth and transforming economic and sustainable livelihoods.
We will begin the programme to build economic and social infrastructure. We will begin and implement a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land reform and food security.
We will strengthen the capacity and capacity of staff. We will improve the health profile of all South Africans.
Working together with all South Africans, we will intensify the fight against crime and corruption. We will build cohesive, sustainable and sustainable communities.
Working together with Africa and the rest of the world, we will need to find a way to continue to co-operate with international trade.
We will ensure proper regulatory and sustainable use of resources.
Also, in partnership with the people and supported by our public servants, we will build a developmental, improved social services and strengthening democratic institutions.
It is a pleasure and honour for me to highlight the key elements of our programme to work.
The creation of good work will be at the heart of our economic performance.
In line with our beliefs, we need to shift in promoting inclusive economy.
In this regard, we will utilise all government mechanisms such as procurement, licensing and financial support to assist small business, including increasing the implementation of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment strategy.
Expenditure will be done in recognition the need to redress the past.
Transforming will be brought to support women, youth and persons with disabilities.
We will reduce the burden of control on small businesses. The case ofmbele by regulations have been mentioned in several occasions.
In some intervention to create an environment that enables investment to take place, government will focus on one integrated business registration system.
This will improve customer services and reduce the cost of doing business in South Africa.
Another key element of our drive to create employment opportunities is the Expanded Public Works Programme.
The second phase of the programme aims to create four million work opportunities by 2014.
Between now and December 2009, we plan to create about 500 000 work opportunities.
While we are creating decent work environment and business opportunities, government ensures that some citizens continue to be helped with government grants to eliminate poverty.
We recognise the need to integrate social grants and economic or economic activity to encourage self-employed people.
More importantly at this time, neighbours need to help each other.
Now is the time of engagement. Let us help ourselves.
Let us hope that there should not be a child who will suffer from hungry because of his parents did not work together, we can do more.
Distinguished guests, as part of this strategy before we continue our programme to build economic and social infrastructure.
This group is still developing the National Infrastructure Development Strategies will ensure that the R877 billion to be used for infrastructure as set out earlier this year is well implemented.
This money includes the provision of housing for the programme to build schools, transport including the state-owned Transport system, housing, water and sanitation.
One of the major foreign investment projects in the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, strengthened government as a nation as a whole that the World Cup will benefit from our children and our country.

The nation will recall that during the State of the Nation Address, I announced that the Expanded Public Works Programme will create 500 seats in December 2009.
These work opportunities have provided unemployed people, experience and duration of training.
We are pleased to announce that in December, we have created more than 480 000 work opportunities in government, which is 97% that we had set ourselves to ensure that these local suppliers and industrial infrastructure projects.
We know that this and other initiatives will not help to fight the recession. We wish the spirit of family work, the community has a voluntary work that encourages many people who are involved in this struggle.
Economic indicators say that we are on the best track.
Economic activities of the South African economy, and we expect growth, while continuing work Statistics, released Tuesday, show that the economy is already creating continuing to alleviate poverty, while reducing unemployment.
Our programme of our infrastructure programme will help us grow rapidly. Our education and skills development programmes will increase productivity and competition.

It is set up recommendations to enable employers to encourage employers to encourage employers to encourage firms and create experience.
A further expansion of government employment programmes is under way.
This includes home resources and home-based projects and literacy and numeracy, home care, efforts to foster schools and early childhood development.
Last year we launched the National Youth Development Agency.
Develop its blows, throughout the country, so that it will prioritise youth development programmes within government.
As this government begins to govern itself, we have promised to work hard to build a new society, we have said that the country responds to the needs and the people of the year, and will act quickly, as soon as possible.
The characteristics of this government will be that you know where people live, understands their needs and responds quickly.
Government must act quickly, strength and intelligence.
We will look forward to Governments and Public Works to follow this vision.
We build a society based on performance, in order to improve planning and review and performance review. We also need to strengthen gender equity in the Government Anti-Makist Programmes, ensuring that women have access to development opportunities.
We are pleased to announce a new way of doing things in government.
The work of the departments will be measured by outcomes, developed by the performance review systems and assess the performance of our performance.
The ministers responsible for particular outcome, will sign an agreement with the President's performance agreement. The Accord which must be made, how it will be done, by whom, during the time determined and utilisation of any resources.
As you know, we have committed to five targets: education, health, rural development and land reform, creating decent work, fight crime.
In addition, we will work towards improving the performance of local government, infrastructure development and social stability.
We will be committed to a number of main activities to achieving these results.
We have put education and skills development within government policies.
In our 2010 programme, we wish to improve our children's ability to read, write and count on the foundation.
If we do not do this, we will not improve the quality of education. our educational goals is but it is essential.
We want learners and teachers to be in school, class, during time, learning and teaching for seven hours a day.
We will help teachers to provide the educative education plans with information. Please, we will provide workbooks for all languages since this year, with literacy and literacy of literacy and literacy rates.
Furthermore, everything of our 27 000 schools will be assessed by officials from the Department of Basic Education will be recorded on the report directly increase the number of student students at 175 000 in 2014.
We call on parents to work together with us to ensure that this happens. We welcome last month's statement by the labour unions, NATOU, SATOU and ensure their contribution to the Pudulent of 2010.
We must invest in our youth to ensure efficient labour to support growth and job creation.
We therefore propose to increase the training of 16-25 in more education and training infrastructure, which will enable us to provide a second educative education scheme, who did not qualify for universities and that are eligible to ensure that all eligible studies are met.
We also set targets which we wish to achieve skills development, producing technical politicians, and increasing the number of qualified Mathematics and Science teachers.
We must also increase the number of young people who are involved in independent and public institutions.
Another result is to ensure that all South Africans have a better life. We will continue to improve health care, infrastructure and improve hospitals and well-being (BDF) and improve co-operation and improve hospitals and improve the effectiveness of the health and efficiency of the Sectors and well as well-operation (BDB) and improve the implementation of the health and improve the implementation of the infrastructure programme.
We must continue to face the issue of living from hunger, declined from 60 years since 1994 to reduce the health of HIV and AIDS infection and that alcohol and drugs have been translated into alleviation of TB into alleviation and that alleviation of TB infection.
We work hard to ensure that everyone where South Africa is safe and safely. We will continue our work to reduce violent crime, ensure that the justice system works better than 10% of the poorest to implement the plans.
We see fighting mutual recognition (in respect), theft of local and home, as well as contact crimes against murder, rape and rape, as high priority.
Let us stop buying stolen goods.
Let us always be ready to provide the police with crime activities.
With cooperation we can stop crime.
The Local Government has to work. Municipalities to improve housing, sanitation, electricity, water treatment and roads has also taken place a meeting with district municipalities who have been allocated to the mainly in Mpumalanga.
A number of issues have already been considered. Nzimkulu ministers to deal with issues remained by the Agency, although there is no co-operatives, it has also been dealt with in the spirit of Classment and the Leadership in December.
This will ensure that local government has the management, administration and capacity required to perform the function.
During this year of action, let us work together to make local government work. We are working to improve unlawfully and provide efficient services and over 50 000 households to set aside over 6 000 housing sector.
A new initiative will be to provide people with their income earnings higher receiving government assistance, but those earning less than a housing rebate on the R1 billion rand guaranteeing housing subsidies.
Colleagues, last year, rural people have the right to electricity, water and electricity connections, metropolitan and via centres also like sport.
In this regard, we have established the first education in the area of the Rural Development in Giyani, Limpopo, in August last year since then, the provision of housing has been invested in support of 231 and upgrading the development of housing.
Access to health and education has improved.
We implement programmes like programmes in some sites around the country, benefiting 21 wards for 2014, we aim to have sites around 160 wards. We need 60% of households to meet their food security needs by 2014.
Small-scale will be the right, as much as being said, small things begin.
We also want to integrate land reform and agricultural reform and agricultural reform programmes. Our industrialisation will be limited to the number of black farmers or minerals to emerge the economy.
Our country has not fallen when it comes to water.
But, we still lose more water through rehabilitation of pipes and inadequate infrastructure. We will set a number of steps to lose water loss by half by 2014.
As part of our country's efforts to encourage economic growth, we are working to reduce the cost of communication. South African broadband can also expect re reduction of alternative technologies (inclusive technologies), as well as telephone, and other technologies.
This government will ensure that our environmental assets and natural resources are protected, and it is renewable regularly.
Neither with Brazil, India and China, as well as the United States, which represents the developed countries, we contribute a major contribution to the adoption of the Convention on Climate Change as is necessary.
We will work harder to efforts and abroad that we are bound this Agreement South Africa, we have committed ourselves to decrease the spread of our country, and continue working on our long-term climate change.
We will intensify efforts to promote the interests of South Africa in the international community. We will support efforts to speed up economic integration in the SADC region, and promoting regional and investment.
South Africa will continue to play a role in continental efforts to strengthen continent in the African Union and its organs, and acting on the Acceleration of the Review of the Partnership, such as developing continent.
Public Works must respond to the application to that this phase of activity is urgently and to improve performance.
We need a high level of work and hard work. We need public servants, capable and maintaining public needs. Government is now working with developing and implementing all government policies and standards that will set out in all spheres of government.
We continue to efforts to eradicate corruption and fraud in the process of hand-over state-owned government, and in the applications for driver's driving licence, social grants, many instances, which are in favour of the Portfolio Committee.
As we know, we have begun the Presidential Hotline to enable government and the Presidency to deliver on flexibility, and help resolving these barriers were in place for service delivery to make a difference in our diversity.
We cannot say Mr Buziwe Nuleka Mount Fount Fount Franre, who was calling on the retired her husband, who wishes to start his first working day.
This is a small story for many of our success.
For these and other examples, we have seen where we are missing from all government's performance and how we can organise it.
I have outlined the main objectives of our 2010 plans, in conclusion, to all of us as the South African State of the Nation Address provides an overview of our plan of action to give their Budget Speech.

Food processing has three components - agriculture, manufacturing and the food sector, duplicate and duplication in large firms from the size of employing saltyle and large hundreds of Imale.
The overall objective of the Department of Labour covers the first two categories in this programme - agriculture and Food and business falls on the responsibility of the local government health and safety, although the Department of Labour is to ensure that these interventions are unformal to change in matters.
The health of the area is more difficult to manage than safety. Poverty and the effects of poor safety are easily accessible to control. The causes relate to weak health and safety, while continuing relatively low often ignored.
For many common health professionals, such as injuries, there may be other causes that the work of the Employees he or she does not want to alleviate or alleviate the necessary causes of occupational health or occupational injuries.
Despite this having information on solutions to work related to health problems, the knowledge of the community can be reduced. Small businesses in more health professionals, but who often have access to health, business, particularly vulnerable to the poor.

Many information can be gained from the workers themselves, Employees can be afraid to allow the health problems to the directors think they think they will obey the work or secret privacy, however, to collect their personal or confidential or secret information.
As any health and safety problem, compliance must be monitored. Where necessary, communicating an alleviation is an offence, the Public Protector must be prevailing with the best interests of the employer.
While all possible substances are done to prevent people suffer from work, there will be possibilities where one occupational illness can cause illness can cause harm the disease, but it is likely to be prevalence that the effects of the work of knee.
Have you evaluated and meet the occupational health requirements?
Risk assessment can identify the main activities and conditions which may harm the health and take a decision to meet the requirements of your occupational asthmatoes (e.g. food handle food handle hazardous substances), dust, if required for occupational dust, (e.g. woods), dust as well as substances are required for hazardous substances).
Do you have the overview of the management of measure, investigations and control allegations, such as the impact of members from the time to time to time to time, lifting the WRULDs or revitude necessary for rehabilitation?
Professional arrangements for the design of facilities, machinery, location and work-related places are taken into consideration in reducing vibration, power required and transform the structure.
Consider job change, speed up the task, recovery and allowance and careful when the time increased or during hours during the course of many.
Reduce the injuries as possible by fighting these three causes.
This will help to ensure that people are not empowered abandon or those with difficulties or conditions.
Ensure that the risks associated with the risks are not provided to people who are identified so that they have work and injuries that reported injured people.
Employees should be guided and given information on the basis of injuries and cause of injuries, lifting methods (in particular and methods of carrying out the need to report back injuries.
Explore workers in hazardous work when they begin work, e.g. after four weeks, ensuring there are no signs to work.
Many work are identified above, but you can also revise rehabilitation and exploitation.
Review the health of workers, e.g. after four weeks, takes care, treatment and other requirements.
To ensure that the approach of the WRULDs are effective, it must be dealt with regularly.
Note that any existing work is dangerous.
Engage mechanisation where possible, e.g. power shacks, telecommunications, rising machinery, riseing bulk or bulk suppliers.
Where mechanism is not possible, initiate measures to prevent injustice, e.g.
Communication and safety representatives on trade union or other representatives of employers and workers to ensure effective solutions to problems.
Working in the rest and where co-operation is situated can create climate change from activities such as healthcare, cold and genetic material.

Access to health and education has improved.
We implement programmes like programmes in some sites around the country, benefiting 21 wards for 2014, we aim to have sites around 160 wards. We need 60% of households to meet their food security needs by 2014.
Small-scale will be the right, as much as being said, small things begin.
We also want to integrate land reform and agricultural reform and agricultural reform programmes. Our industrialisation will be limited to the number of black farmers or minerals to emerge the economy.
Our country has not fallen when it comes to water.
But, we still lose more water through rehabilitation of pipes and inadequate infrastructure. We will set a number of steps to lose water loss by half by 2014.
As part of our country's efforts to encourage economic growth, we are working to reduce the cost of communication. South African broadband can also expect re reduction of alternative technologies (inclusive technologies), as well as telephone, and other technologies.
This government will ensure that our environmental assets and natural resources are protected, and it is renewable regularly.

We continue to efforts to eradicate corruption and fraud in the process of hand-over state-owned government, and in the applications for driver's driving licence, social grants, many instances, which are in favour of the Portfolio Committee.
As we know, we have begun the Presidential Hotline to enable government and the Presidency to deliver on flexibility, and help resolving these barriers were in place for service delivery to make a difference in our diversity.
We cannot say Mr Buziwe Nuleka Mount Fount Fount Franre, who was calling on the retired her husband, who wishes to start his first working day.
This is a small story for many of our success.
For these and other examples, we have seen where we are missing from all government's performance and how we can organise it.

In this regard, we have a strong and democratic functional of democracy, and institutions, that we have managed to overcome this difficulty with dignity and dignity.
Today's work is to celebrate what makes this democracy work. It also celebrates our culture for continuing and accountable collective responsibility.
This also has proof of the existence of our icon Madiba, who has laid the foundation for a nation, and the existence of President Thabo Mbeki, who built on that basis.
Further progress has also been made with the fact that former President Kgalema Motlanthe is now the Deputy President of the Republic, after many of this transition, and in many respects.
As you can be aware, the fight against poverty remains one of our focus.
We cannot, and we will never dwel ourselves, in our fight against poverty.
To achieve these goals, our government has chosen 10 priorities, which is part of the Germanent Strategic Framework for 2009 to 2014.
This programme is being initiated under difficult economic conditions.
The past year has saw the global economy over the past of the crisis has never been in the past decade.
While South Africa is not affected by this way the number of other countries affected, its present implications are increasingly seen in our economy, we have also affected the impact of the economy.
It is important now more than ever before we work together in the same programme to have a response to this crisis.
We regard as our first place of the South African response to the global economic crisis, which has been achieved by government, labour and business in February this year, we must take action to reduce the impact of the current vulnerable.
We have begun to work to reduce the loss of unemployment. There is consensus between government and state-owned enterprises to initiate the process of training.
These workers will be faced with dismissal as a result of the economic problems will be displayed in a particular time and the ability once again.
The discussion of the process of continuing interaction between people who work with these areas will be affected by this initiative, including the Sector Education and Training.
We will support the work of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to assist employers and workers to find otherwise without delay in terms of relevant legal procedures.
To date, CCMA commissioners have saved more than four thousand jobs through facilitation processes, and give advice and support workers who have been postponed.
The Small Enterprise Development Corporation has begun the programme to provide finance to the most vulnerable companies.
Building on the successes of our industrial policy interventions, the Industrial Policy Action Plan will be introduced.
Priority areas that have been selected are transport, chemicals, tourism, clothing and textiles, as well as forestry, and expansion, with regard to innovation, facilitation of innovation and innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation and development.
As part of Phase 2 of the Expanded Public Works Programme, the Public Works Programme will be speeded up.
It provides a minimum level of regular work to those who need, while improving the quality of life to the community.
Economic growth will affect the speed that our country can address the social and economic challenges our country faces.
The priorities that we have identified, and plans we put before the voters, remain at the heart of this government programme.
In the spirit of South African citizens, let us embrace our hands to find solutions to the time they come to work hard.
Our government will look forward, not later!
The steps outlined in our Medium Term Strategic Framework Strategic Framework must take into account which is maintained by the economic crisis, Decentralisation should not make these plans effective.
We decides that work together to speed up economic growth and transforming economic and sustainable livelihoods.
We will begin the programme to build economic and social infrastructure. We will begin and implement a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land reform and food security.
We will strengthen the capacity and capacity of staff. We will improve the health profile of all South Africans.
Working together with all South Africans, we will intensify the fight against crime and corruption. We will build cohesive, sustainable and sustainable communities.
Working together with Africa and the rest of the world, we will need to find a way to continue to co-operate with international trade.
We will ensure proper regulatory and sustainable use of resources.
Also, in partnership with the people and supported by our public servants, we will build a developmental, improved social services and strengthening democratic institutions.
It is a pleasure and honour for me to highlight the key elements of our programme to work.
The creation of good work will be at the heart of our economic performance.
In line with our beliefs, we need to shift in promoting inclusive economy.
In this regard, we will utilise all government mechanisms such as procurement, licensing and financial support to assist small business, including increasing the implementation of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment strategy.
Expenditure will be done in recognition the need to redress the past.
Transforming will be brought to support women, youth and persons with disabilities.
We will reduce the burden of control on small businesses. The case ofmbele by regulations have been mentioned in several occasions.
In some intervention to create an environment that enables investment to take place, government will focus on one integrated business registration system.
This will improve customer services and reduce the cost of doing business in South Africa.
Another key element of our drive to create employment opportunities is the Expanded Public Works Programme.
The second phase of the programme aims to create four million work opportunities by 2014.
Between now and December 2009, we plan to create about 500 000 work opportunities.
While we are creating decent work environment and business opportunities, government ensures that some citizens continue to be helped with government grants to eliminate poverty.
We recognise the need to integrate social grants and economic or economic activity to encourage self-employed people.
More importantly at this time, neighbours need to help each other.
Now is the time of engagement. Let us help ourselves.
Let us hope that there should not be a child who will suffer from hungry because of his parents did not work together, we can do more.
Distinguished guests, as part of this strategy before we continue our programme to build economic and social infrastructure.
This group is still developing the National Infrastructure Development Strategies will ensure that the R877 billion to be used for infrastructure as set out earlier this year is well implemented.
This money includes the provision of housing for the programme to build schools, transport including the state-owned Transport system, housing, water and sanitation.
One of the major foreign investment projects in the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, strengthened government as a nation as a whole that the World Cup will benefit from our children and our country.

The meeting will initiate a series of consultation with those who are affected by the BRT system.W confidence that these matters will not be dealt with and satisfied with all parties involved.
This will include the key issues that all those affected will benefit from these efforts.
Another development that must help the World Cup is the launch of digital broadcasting and broadcasting of broadcasting power.
In all, we will ensure that the cost of telecommunications is reduced through broadcast projects under way to boost broadband capacity.
We must ensure that we have not left rural areas behind stimulating developments.
As part of the development of human resource development we will provide sustainable housing to the poor and cost effective human settlements.
We will continue to understand that human settlement is only the construction of housing.
It is a matter of transforming our cities and building cohesive and cohesive communities, sustainable and sustainable communities and community infrastructure, including sport and recreation.
In this spirit, we will work with Parliament to speed up the processing of the Land Use Management Bill.
Working together with our people in rural areas, we will ensure a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land reform and the security and third priority.
I should like to use this opportunity to extend our condolences with the family of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Dirk du Toit, who passed the late last week since her contribution will be remembered.
People in rural areas also have the right to electricity and water, sanitation, roads, sport and recreation; including selling posts such as urbanisation.
They also have the right to assistance in agriculture so that they can grow vegetables and other things; and so that animals can feed themselves.
We are committed to launch this campaign to build rural areas. We are partnership with civil society, councillors and principals to speed up this work.
We urge rural people to start preparing to tell us what things they need, working together we can do more.
While we have learn lessons from the rural development initiatives, we have chosen a Greater Giyani Local Municipality in Limpopo as a pilot project for lessons from the countrywidemic.

The Public Participation Week is a way of improving dialogue and organisation between government and government. It provides a platform to discuss the Programme of Action that will be done to promote community participation and government.
The Public Participation Week empowers the opportunity to meet with citizens, accountable to the delivery of action.
A direct organisation between three spheres of government (including provinces and local government) ensures that government affects its people.
During this week communities and government will meet regularly as ward committees, and sectoral meetings to address challenges and share solutions.
The emphasis will be on ensuring communities as logistics of solutions, supported by a active government.
The Presidential Hotline has also introduced other ways of improving consultation between government and people, and to speed up service delivery.
We address the challenges identified by various other organisations and investigations.
We have made significant progress over the past 15 years of freedom, the challenges remain.
61.7% in 1994 to 91.8% in March 2009, much has to be done to provide services to people behind.
We are near to meet our goal to eradicate the bucket system in the right society, the target date for universal access is 2014.
We are concerned about high unemployment, poverty, health care and poor development, particularly in rural and informal settlements.
Let us use these meetings to meet with community representatives and prevent damage the leaflets that help them.

The National Language Policy Framework was able to succeed as a result of my discussions through LANGTAG) to work with the Jewish Language Legislature and the policy framework in which linguistic diversity and the language of our country.
This policy framework therefore reflects the importance of our languages depends on the economic, political and elaboration of the day's linguistic communities, and the promotion of all of our linguistic diversity, as well as the promotion of the indigenous languages of our linguistic diversity, and the promotion of the promotion of all of the linguistic diversity of our linguistic communities, and the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic communities and in South Africa.
I am confident that all South Africans will adopt this policy framework for language policy as I hope that we act together together, we must ensure that all policy that we realise this policy is realising as we celebrate.
1.1 All South Africans have at least 25 official languages spoken, with 11 official languages in terms of Section 69 of the Constitution (Act No. 108 of 1996), as a result of 9.

1.8 This document is a framework for multilingualism working in accordance with the Constitution.
Since the beginning of the South African Mathematics, during the course of the election, the government's language policy and the period does not recognise the factual multilingualism in South Africa's linguistic diversity.
These bodies have resulted in inequality and emphasis on indication of other languages, English and Afrikaans has been widely maintained over the African languages.

To that we have over the past five months to ensure a peace and security transformation of state is to thank the size of our constitutional system, which demonstrated by the Executive, as well as the Executive Council of the Executive, and the Executive authorities and the Executive Council.
Looking back over the past 15 years, I wish to thank the volunteer and work of President Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and many women who are in the administration of the past three years of democracy, to improve the quality of life of all South African Legislature and to improve the democratic values of the national executive and to the administration of the national executive.
In all, I warmly warmly warmly warmly with confidence that South Africa we celebrate today - has created conflict prevention, exclusion and symbolism from the past racism is a result of all South Africans.
Between the South African diinguished media is our members of our democracy that we have a tragedy from 9 Johannesburg, as well as the Ban Union Build and Ban Union Buildlack, Koreoyen.
For those, I would like to extend the Ms Helen Suzman, the honoured South Africans, who supported our best practices of our new Parliament in the former homes.
We also need some of these patrios to gain a large part of the hall we announced that today, although the homeland of our economy, although our political will alleviate unity will albeish our political will, albeites unity.
However, we should not underestimate the challenges we face. The weakness of the global economy is threatened to our economy in respect of unemployment and social security.
Naturally, the political doubt can give more than these questions now have answers.
Consequently, some of us may be interviewed by a few nuclear weather conditions on the fruits of economic and political impact.
But our question is the journey of confidence and prevention.
We may say that, unprecedented progress, many aspects of our constitutional mandate have been overdue, and everything of the examines our democracy prevailing democracy.
Our democracy is borrowing up!
Of course, the importance of political discussions during the period of elections, which we all agreed to win and peace, is a real guarantee of the Ikage and sustainable democracy.
It is the people of South Africans who can guarantee its growth, and we will defend our democracy in the future.
Allow me, Madam Speaker and Chairperson, on this environment for all South Africans to register and vote in the national and provincial elections, so that we can build our future.
This we must do every day of work at the offices, the election of the voters roll it.
I would also like to use this opportunity to show, in the following booklet, I will conclude with the Judiciary and the Presidents to inform the date of election.
Distinguished guests; what we have seen as democracy because of the people of South Africa, 27 May 1994, the first time they will take their future into their own hands.
Using these immediate action, it is important to vote for the government of all people of our country, we have always missed the humanitarian impact of our people.
So, it is necessary for this opportunity to celebrate 20 years of Freedom of Declaration for African Unity Advolution of the African Peop Protocol, the South African Revenue Service and the general peace of the Translaration of the Power of Conference in 1989.
All this has led to the process of negotiating the election of our democracy in 1994.
In this regard, we must honour the South African National Defence Force, Oliver Reliver Tambo, to have begun and attempt to secure international bodies in our country.
Such a country of ownership will shape the framework that will result in peace and reconciliation rather than the dispute backs after the previous Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, for the ratification of 190 years.
While that treaty also defines the dignity of the South African nation as it became today, it is based on the impact of the apartheid system.
So, over the past 15 years of democracy, we can say that the fear, welfare, and pension, with the past 100 years ago there have been no peace without fear and unjust.
As such as the lack of care for remedying the tree for the years of Earm, we honour our peoples of our people, Socian, Mahlangu, Mahlangu is warming 30 years.
Solomon Mahlangu was continuing the colour of the year of yesterday, we want to see young people under the former Ceoexprisoner who sacrifices 187, who sacrificed their country, and the Leaders of State.
Three hundred and thirty of log frames, we can save confidence and maintaining frustration.
In the educational institutions, such a rehabilitation of the rehabilitation of the violent rehabilitation after enhancing the movement of freedom fighter and high levels of leadership.
The student movement team has pledged from Angas to launch the South African Student Association, Saso, 40 years ago.
In this event, the leaders of the January of Sasmany, who were Strine Moodley, the Phina Barria, Steward, Hopplege, Mahlanguge, Mahlangu, Mahlangu, Mahlangu, said the Nigge, Mahlangu, Mahlangu, Mahlangu, i.
In this context, we also wish to acknowledge the Ephrage Ephrage President, the first 30 years of the South African Mathematics of Association, Cosmetre and association.
The main lines in reminding these studies this year of lifelong learning and reduction, so that the archives of our youth.
An outline of their friendship is truly maintained today, as has done many years ago, that we have to expand the posts of culture, heritage, he said, "be said.
We recall the associations with leaders to emphasize confidence and maintaining the struggle for democracy even if all these obstacles are unstable; ensure that the responsibility we are resistant to deliver on many of them, and it may be soldiers.
So, Madam Speaker and Honourable Chairperson, we have to ask ourselves: What impact on the road to improve the democratic movement of South Africa, and how did we involve our democracy?
Today we have a system of participatory democracy, in accordance with the principles of transparency and transparency, which has many public bodies to contribute to the institutions that have been approved by the Constitution.
A number of years, we have improved administrative structures. We have developed a system of intergovernmental relations system in all areas and improved coordination between it.
Indeed, government can deeply proud that we have transformed the demographic structure of the Public Service Commission, which looks at all aspects related to the structure of our society.
However, while women constitute about 34% of the high levels of Public Service, which is still lacking relatively unknown.
In the state of the national and provincial legislatures, signs that the national government will convey the level of representation of women in 2004, and we believe that 40% of the elections have been made since the general election of government, and we will contribute to the fact that 40% of the election of the Cabinet!
While increasing certain improvements have been made, 0,2% the situation is particularly worse about people living with disabilities employed in government, measuring 2% target date.
In all, the private sector is lagging behind.
Many steps have been implemented to improve the effectiveness of the Public Service Commission, including the financial management, Thusong Service and new processes of service delivery, are now the same leadership of the Department of Home Affairs.
However, much more needs to be done to improve the standard of service and other government officials, especially those who work directly with citizens.
Skills you will be aware, our government has committed to fighting corruption in the most important areas of the programme.
It may be that the systems that prevent corruption and alleviation are not enough, but in the public's perspective, we can alleviate corruption that over 70% of the corruption reported because the manifestation has gone wrong.
Similar challenges face entrepreneurs in conclusion, this challenge concerns the management as long as the legal persistent.
Frankly, I believe that we all agree that the welfare of our society depends on the continuity that we are making a nation's frustration and ensure that benefits are shared by all.
under 1940s
Over the first ten years of freedom, the economic growth has grown to average of 3% in year, and this has improved to 5% in 2004 to 2014.
While the number of consumers rising overload, by increasing employment, employment equity and rising incomes and higher rates and high rates, employment has worked, encouraging employment, encouraging employment opportunities.
This includes, in the first place, higher rates of investment by government and business. Earm, over the past five years, we have been proposing a total of 15% in the country's capital investment, as we have been determined by almost 5% target date for investment in the country's domestic capital investment and investment by 2014.
It is also due to the policies to improve the climate of state-owned enterprises and developing state-owned enterprises and the implementation of such taxes, as increased access to services and reducing the burden of increased fiscalisation and sustainability.
The focus on reforms of economic reforms over the past decade, and good ports, since 2004, which have been designed to remove economic obstacles to economic growth and impact.
We are in this context, the Hatlan and Transforming and Asia Economic Empowerment, Asgisa, it is currently utilised, ensure that all obstacles are necessary to accelerate government's ability to address broaderstream infrastructure programmes, to address the challenges of government.
Our economy is very clear, and since 1994 has grown substantially to inclusion in the multilateral system.
Similarly, its target to our society remains under the expectations of our economy remains a major role in mining and foreign exports, particularly the sector of growth, particularly the business sector.
Indeed, the rate of investment in export earnings is not high in terms of other countries, it is an incomplete deficitration that exceeds the value of our exports, as long as we are concerned.
These are challenges that our country has to resolve to continue.
More importantly it is question: What about economic growth must be impacted to improve the quality of life of the people, the issue of economic growth, if the economy is to be shared?
Of course, to share the benefits of economic growth must involve employment, ensure employment and good work, it is a very interesting issue between 1995 and the economy has created just about 3 000 new jobs, with just created just 3 000 new jobs.
During the period ahead, the first time since the introduction of democracy, many jobs have been created more than young people entering the labour market, therefore alleviate unemployment from 31% in 2007.
Yes, this should not be pillar from work to further examines the question of work to cover the activities which workers enjoy.
To share the benefits of economic growth must include accelerate implementation of the process of providing work for those who have been excluded, and black economic empowerment, BEEE.
This is not an unexpectedly contradiction and this is a true racially racial agenda, a society that is not guaranteed to all the conditions of economic activity with regard to unity.
The issue of underestimate state-owned enterprises is postponing demographic shifts in management and capacity, business development and labour, that is the basis of our economy profit.
To share the benefits of economic growth also means the work of government to speed up and equivalence the use of state fund as a tool to restore the burden of retrenchment of state assets.
Naturally, you will be familiar with more information on issues concerning social welfare, I will quote a few examples to regain the nature we have done facing its challenges.
Government has also signed a pain that poverty remains high in our society, and the proportion of inequality is high.
Over the past 15 years we have committed ourselves to fighting peace and social cohesion through social wage.
"Flobalization, Minister Mobilisation of Defence Force Intergovernmental Relations Law.
Between families (including children, 17 and 17 years), the proportion of households that the child was hungry and hungry has grown significantly from 31 per cent of poverty and that alcohol and that alcoviation from 31 percent in 2002) has improved the poor.
Poverty Mobilisation: Being married, pg25 people with Berg Stellenbosch.
Of course, this information is intensified by our own research, indicating that the financial poverty, especially in some Black and Boloureds have increased, in 2008, due to high rates of income and social grants, as a result of 125 million residents have increased access to 125 million.
This is particularly due to the extension of the Child Capital Delivery, which has increased from 34 000 people in 2008.
As part of the contributions to the Unemployment Insurance, a total of 1 million work opportunities through the Expanded Public Works Programmes have been achieved in 2008, before the year of the election was set up in 2004.
With regard to basic services, the numbers speak for themselves. For instance, access to water increased from 62% in 1996 to 88% in 2008.
The achievement of high social wage is also seen as a great deal of access to health facilities.
We also reinforced that research in the cases of HIV will show sustained and slightened infection numbers.
only larger people globally, but it is growing at the time of more than 690 000 patients who have been born out of antiretroviral treatment from the beginning of the programme.
While many health facilities were always the necessary medication, the appropriate health services, the provision of basic services such as clean water and electricity, other resources are needed.
In education, we have seen the introduction of teacher: learner, at least the country's access to primary education, and better than the number of babies, with examples.
At the same time, most power has been given to improve infrastructure in poor areas.
As it is known, we also know the number of people who are abolished, particularly at secondary and tertiary level, it is highly unacceptable, and the education system also needs to produce the necessary capabilities.
Furthermore, the process on performance, both the training and teaching and learning, reflecting the impression of the past society.
In reality, the education is especially needed to maximise the cycle of poverty, as infrastructure, skills and understanding can be under-development.
Programmes for social development have also improved the majority of the government's needs, such as housing, with the provision of 2,6 million government housing supplied.
We must, as it is known, acknowledging the Land Reform, including continuing support, it should be made more effective and better.
In general, we are proud of achievements in social development programmes, but we cannot ignore the change only figures.
Not to education, health, housing, water or sanitation, the main issue we face is how to improve these services while still lacking.
Having fruited, a violent commission remains the main reason for the South African welfare of the day, day and date on which these sites were faithful, and so that the attacks are prevalent.
With regard to the public and private sector, there may be a larger infrastructure programme.
It is known, theverage of crime which crime increased in 2002, remains at the universities of the numbers can be stabilised to ensure this.
But we know that this decline has not been as far as practicable, while rising 7% to 10% which we have set up a number of crimes against everyone's violent crimes against crime.
This demonstrates failure in the areas that we live, especially in building social cohesion that will assist in the fight against crime and showcase the system of crime and the justice system in investigating matters of crime prevention and corruption.
But if we are all our ourselves, we must remember that the system that we are taking the system more precisely than the systems in the country.
This is done in respect of existing studies from common human rights, structure and accountability system.
But we can revisibilise: as our lives, this transition is still the beginning stage.
I hope that our young people will agree with me that our democracy depends on vulnerable people.
In this regard, by lawmaking, agreements with other countries, regulations and campaigns have been initiated, we have proved to improve the moralthics of children, women and persons with disabilities.
In support of campaigns and partnerships that we can build and institutions that are underestimate the social groups, we can raise awareness about things that affect and organise these concerns.
We are proud, for instance, by having led families by women adopted a large part of social assistance, including housing and health, and many of its programmes that came out in school immunization campaigns and child education.
However, ladies and gentlemen, young people with disabled still have difficulties to find employment.
This is what we need to do in future.
Madam Speaker and Chairperson, some of the signs expressed by democracy and what government has been able to realise the desire of the Air and a relatively small amount of work we have done since 1994 and that we have been achieved.
Illegal Emposium on Freedom Charter, Illegal Empowerment, Ilfare, Illegal, Illegal, Illegal, Illegal, Illegal, Illegalisation.
In the coming months, our country's society will determine the leader who wishes to continue the work of the free and other middle of this democracy.
While our performance is different, the goals of things we want to achieve is undoubtedly because it is enshrined in our Constitution, not to build a united and prosperous, non-racial, non-racial or non-sexist society.
The past six years, our leaders have met with the Expanded Public Works Summit and Development where we can reach agreement all our work that we all have to improve the lives of our communities, especially the rainfall and poverty by 2014.
To promote home-based work and initiate development, including infrastructure and access to services.
I believe, as part of this objectives, South Africans have no need to improve our education system; to provide adequate, sustainable and sustainable development; and ensure adequate nutrition; and sustainable development; and ensure adequate nutrition of our communities; and ensure adequate nutrition.
But I don't quote these issues because it is more important than anything or think that will be a national healthier society. I do so to emphasise the fact that South Africa does not accept this vision is the transformation of our projects.
These threats are welcomed by everyone, as seen in the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, however, today face the achievement of economic recession.
This is not only seen as a financial crisis in small and loaning settlements have become a major frentices of the world economy resulted in a negative impact on the development of goods and services.
We still remain unambiguous, short-term and allegations of senior managers who contribute to this situation. We can condemn government policies that are unable to ensure that these are empowered to the market.
But our task is to understand the result of these things in our economy and our region and also find ways to reduce the result, especially in the private and security.
This we know is that the state of control in our country and regulating tax policies to address economic growth that we have also helped to avoid a negative outcome of this moment.
But we know that, because we have a co-ordinated and integrated economy, the requirements of the export earnings have decreased; access to finance and it has been impacted on the development of the country's goods and services.
That is difficult to coincide with the time flow of goods and services income generated above thanks to the Banfit Director-General who will reduce income earnings.
Overall, this has been negatively affected by the funds we had to expand services and expand infrastructure projects.
We know and believe that South Africa has affected better than other countries, indeed some countries face enormous economic difficulties in South Africa, and the continent's economic growth and expansion.
In this regard, honourablely, I am pleased to report that discussions to the Presidency and various leaders of the various social partners have agreed to reducing the negative impact of our economy in our country.
Firstly, government will continue with the social capital investment project that has increased to R60 billion over the next three years.
This will include the support of the development financial and loans organisations from international borrowing organisations, including partnership with non-governmental organisations, such as finance, labour and labour-profit organisations.
Secondly, we will intensify government's employment programmes. On the other hand, we will strengthen infrastructure plans to expand health and employment programmes such as public health, education and training institutions will speed up the Expanded Public Works Programme.
Thirdly, we will find ways to reduce the slowdown of investment and liquidation of existing industrial firms.
Government will repair its contribution to the industry and other ways to recovery in firms so that they can face a challenge in different sectors and encourage the development of industry to contribute to industrial development.
Certain measures that will be fill in the loss of infrastructure will be investigated, including the provision of higher education, short-term training, medium and micro-term immigrants, the initiative and the South African Ports.
Fourthly, government will continue to increase money spent socially, including continuing access to the Child caregiver to 18 and reducing the age of qualifying pension for the grant for a grant of 60 years.
Furthermore, we will implement the Public Investment Assistance and Foodstuffs Legislation Unusyment Insurance Fund or consumption that should spend.
We will also pay special attention to the challenge of having other companies consistent with competition.Wel congratulate the Competition Commission on strengthening their hand to ensure that the legislators are filled.
However, we have confidence that people will also enable the price of costs to reach all people.
These measures will be guided by a regulatory fiscal policy for economic growth., we will ensure that the state-owned financial institutions are acceptable and that government has to reduction and reduction it is possible.
Our task will be guided by understanding that these measures we will take to protect the situation and facilitate the turnarounds that we can create employment.
In both G20 and co-operative Governance, our government has come forward to a rapid engagement in developed countries where there is a need to strengthen its oversight and ensure that is oversight.
It is important that we must maintain the integrity of the international trade system, concluding discussions with the International trade-offs and ensure that development benefits are not reduced.
The lesson we can learn is that we should have strong partnerships with our business and our country, not only to eradicate these efforts.
In our country we will do this as part of the process to put our country's progress and growth. Fouring our long-term goals will be untoubtedly, but we will achieve this.
In the world, the way we are prepared to use these posts very important. I am talking about the FIFA World Cup and the way in which we will ensure that all our plans are completed in our country are completed.
After winning the last five sports, we believe that the national football team be ready to make it hard work!
Furthermore, the heritage of this promise will be our ability to reflect the South African humanity and South Africa - transforming all the thoughts of the whole world with our continent and our continent has put that price!
We also wish to congratulate all South Africans who strengthen the impact of better in the past five years.
Yes, how many of the Rugan world; Gini Horille Villia and his team won the Renario Award; Galaly Paralympian continues to play a leading role in the poor; and we have done a team of competitive team.

This is only that we can make sure that we are helping the people of Zimbabwe to find a response to their hall. We wish to congratulate all political parties in Zimbabwe and the soon as possible to meet the deadline of the South African Union.
It is necessary to express my gratitude to the SADC Organised, former President Thabo Mbeki and a working group and patient to ensure effective communication.
Already the rehabilitation task can begin by celebrating enthusiasm and South Africa is committed to assist in resolving the country, as soon as possible, and the need to resolving the people of the country, as soon as possible.
We are encouraging that, although cutting was not elected to the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo on their stable journey to sustainability, and continuing underestimated.
The partnership that was built before the leadership of the DRC and the Central African Peer Review Consular and social security, with regard to the African Union, with regard to the leadership of the Stadium in the continent.

Together, we will improve the SADC dialogue with the South African Maritime Organisation, the Competition of the South African Union, the South African Union, the EACA will be designed to enhance the partnership with the Sac.

Social question.
In this process, the person or the task team listen to discussions from the public sitting.
In some cases, managers may choose to make representations and reports and procedures for public enquiries.

For example, government does not take decisions concerning the lives of the people have been defined what it did.
What is I expect when I apply for?

Everybody may request reasons for the decisions concerning their rights, the reasons for the assigned to the person, if they have not been so.
The way of appealing for the PAJA.
It faxed by mail, fax or fax confirmation.
If people are unable to write, they should ask a friend, the legal practitioner etc. it also means that the Directors of Public Works who are unable to write a decision, the person in writing.
What are the reasons that will be given?
The PAJA refers to managers should give reasons "In enough" Explanation of word "In't means the Director-General will think so that the managers should be responded to the fact that the respondent should be able to give a decision.

What happens if I am not satisfied?
Other departments have a channel to lodge a complaint. Where complaint is lodged a complaint, this must be done before deciding.
The Department of Home Affairs has the Council of Labour to hear the complaints about the decisions of the Office of the Refugee Refugee status, if one wants to apply for a refugee status or refugee status, and may lodge a complaint.
Where there is no way to lodge complaints, or where this is being implemented and the person is not satisfied with the decision, they have the right to court and ask the court to review the court.
Where there is no internal appeal, the matter must be reviewed within 180 days (6 months) the internal appeal has been reviewed, the internal appeal must be reviewed.
Where the departments have a channel to lodge internal appeal, they will also have the conditions to which the complaint may be lodged in the department, the state of the internal appeal, but the application must be lodged with a permanent appeal.
Is there any maintenance?

Why should people be informed by the PAJA?
South Africa has a long history of public service that is unsuccessful and unambiguously acting in ways of bringing together and making people believed to apply for a whole, there is no reason.
The managers are present to serve the public as a result of "profit", which we do not know about or how they have seen themselves.e. everybody has experienced the story of interaction with government.
assist in making public servants accountable and to the people.
What people need to know?
It is important that people need to know that there are rules that managers should know if they are already made decisions on Phase 1 will understand what the rules mean.
Legislation in this communities will help to empower the members of these communities to ensure their rights.
The PAJAU concerns their task, For instance, if the legal practitioner complies with the social or pension problems, he or she does not use the information booklet to determine how to take decisions, for example, how to be taken for personal comment.

The National Language Policy Framework was able to succeed as a result of my discussions through LANGTAG) to work with the Jewish Language Legislature and the policy framework in which linguistic diversity and the language of our country.
This policy framework therefore reflects the importance of our languages depends on the economic, political and elaboration of the day's linguistic communities, and the promotion of all of our linguistic diversity, as well as the promotion of the indigenous languages of our linguistic diversity, and the promotion of the promotion of all of the linguistic diversity of our linguistic communities, and the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic communities and in South Africa.
I am confident that all South Africans will adopt this policy framework for language policy as I hope that we act together together, we must ensure that all policy that we realise this policy is realising as we celebrate.
All South Africans have at least 25 official languages spoken, with 11 official languages in terms of Section 69 of the Constitution (Act No. 108 of 1996), as a result of 91% of the languages of all South African citizens.
The 11 official languages are cemeteries, Pension, English and Purisdiction of official languages, Legalisation, Legalisation, Praclean and other languages);
Hence, South Africa is the multilingualualualualualualualualism.
At the moment there is a great deal of prerequisite for the development of previous languages were disadvantaged in terms of multilingualism so that multilingualism enabling South Africans should use their official languages.
Until now, the administration of the linguistic diversity of our democracy in South Africa has a huge problem because of sound language policy, which resulted in greater use of political and economic policies.
The eighteen years after freedom, South Africa has come to an important era.
the challenges of implementation of multilingualualualualualualualism have also led to the development of this National Language Policy Framework.
The Policy Framework was only promoted in multilingualism in South Africa, but encourages the use of the linguistic official languages as officially promote uniformity in the language of learning and linguistic diversity that promotes mutual respect of human rights.
This document is a framework for multilingualism working in accordance with the Constitution.
Since the beginning of the South African Mathematics, during the course of the election, the government's language policy and the period does not recognise the factual multilingualism in South Africa's linguistic diversity.
These bodies have resulted in inequality and emphasis on indication of other languages, English and Afrikaans has been widely maintained over the African languages.
In that regard, the government's electoral government's rooted the sequence of the linguistic diversity in South Africa.
press and weathers - this has resulted in underestimated and marginalized languages in the bottle, not only with Mzim but these speakers.
This settlement is stimulated as a result of non-governmental organization to decide which does not comply with the Constitution and the short of their views on the matter.
Section 6 of the Constitution enshrines the basis for multilingualism, the development of official languages and promotion of multilingualism in respect of language in which linguistic diversity enshrines the rights of all languages, to be respected in terms of national legislation.
The Constitution emphasises the fact that all official languages must be honoured and treated equally, while promoting the status of indigenous languages of government, while recognising the indigenous languages of the indigenous languages, while recognising the indigenous law and regulatory system.
The Constitution enshrines the status of the languages across the country, and specifically specifically specifically the past racial and non-trants to meet its needs.
Section 6(2) of the Constitution requires a certain process to be used to develop these languages.
government departments should use the private languages under the formal two official languages.
Furthermore, the promotion ofinguistic diversity in terms of paragraph, section 6(5) is in the Constitution of the South African Language Practitioners' Council (SALB) and the promotion of multilingualism and multilingualism.
Other matters concerning the language of the country are located and elsewhere in the Constitution, referred to in section 9(3) to safeguard the provision of language, and in the language of the linguistic people referred to in subsection (1)(s) and to the purposes of the rights of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic communities referred to in subsection (4), for the purposes of the purposes of the purposes of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity, and to in the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity, and to in the linguistic diversity of the linguistic diversity, and to in the linguistic diversity of

The Constitution and other legislation enshrines the use of multilingualism in South Africa.
Language policy takes into account which the Constitution envisages multilingualism and is aligned to the economic, social and social purposes of education.
To promote multilingualism in South Africa does not want to be served on the basis of the knowledge of the communities in which traditional or linguistic diversity will be promoted in the development of civil society.
It will help in envolving studies who have been student in helping us to develop the implementation of multilingualualual programmes through studies and investigating the effects of these qualifications.
It will be necessary to make all reforms to ensure that policy is operational to achieve the implementation of multilingualism in South Africa.
The approach to public participation in the promotion of multilingualism in multilingualism in South Africa is very important if the multilaterparingualism is embarrassed in the country's multilingualism and to integrate the development of multilingualism in the country.
All organs of state (the national government, regional and local governments, as well as all organizations serving the government to act in accordance with national policy framework.
As a mechanism to promote the use of multilingualism, regional and provincial government will also develop policy guidelines in the Policy Framework for consideration as set out in the Constitution.
Local government will choose the languages that will be used in terms of policy-mulation.
The official languages will be used in the government of all legislative and Heritage Legislature and when it comes to the use of language, mountains of the different languages of their dependency.
Government will also encourage and support how non-governmental organisations in developing its policies consistent with national common language policy.
The languages that will be used in documents: In engagement, every government entity must achieve consensus with regard to his language (the language) that will be used in the internal market, but the internalisation of the department has been considered.

Communication and community: When using formal communication, it should be used in the language the citizen is interested.g. communication and / oral communications must be in the language they are entitled to use and use of the linguistic communities.
The documents published by government: The reservist must be followed by all national government departments where publications do not have to be made in 11 official languages.
At the level of government to act where necessary information is transformed to the public, it is necessary that the publication of documents have been completed in 11 official languages and the maintained by the provincial executive.
It will be used to exchange the promotion of multilingualism when it comes to the African Language Practice.
The use of language policy is to transform the role of translation profession and evaluation in traditional and postal translators and higher translation professionals should be expanded to the government departments to improve the effectiveness of these staff.
The launch of the language units in each provincial and local government formulation will also enhance the scope of the activities of the National Language Commission (NSLS) to coordinate the support of the NSOS.

Recognition that this delay applications for investment in respect of issues such as land restitution, infrastructure and environmental impact assessment that will result in all developments or damaging them in the spirit of Business Unusual, as soon as possible, we have taken off course.
The Qualitative Priorities of government will focus on the issues of competent development. The Expanded Public Works Strategy will be completed this year, which will be intensified in the Public Skills Acquisition, strengthened and co-ordinated programmes (GIP) and co-ordinated to monitor and strengthened.
In reality, we are encouraged by positive results from the private sector expressed by the decade of 70 companies that have been set out in Johannesburg and the government's ability to address the challenge.
In addition to this task in the future, we will prioritise interventions in FET colleges, SETAs, infrastructure in three-pronged schools and cost-effective schools, and speed up the training of professional graduates.
Furthermore, the labilisation of weaknesses in the programme of Basic Education, identified last year, the month we will launch the Kha Ri Gude mass literacy campaign (includudududucators) mass literacy training transducators.
Between economic programmes, and it deserves to be, it is an acknowledgement that advances the quality of life of all South Africans, acting as an important weapon to reach a goal of speed up the goal of all.
In the programme to provide human settlements, we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum, and agreement reached SALGA and to set a decision to settle the land on housing programme.
Together with the progress we are making in various interventions focused on poverty reduction, we continue to address the number remaining weaknesses, including the implementation of the Land Use Management Bill, to finalise the support of land reform and the implementation of Land Reform, including the implementation of Land Reform and the programme.
These are some of the issues we have to take this year, and ensure that we achieve the goals we have set ourselves.
Another Value is to define and understanding of the process of fighting poverty, especially the most affected people affected by this problem, including children, women, young people living in urbanisation, rural and urbanisation.
Among the proposed machinery: the programme of government's work programme, employment incentives to create work-related groups, to strengthen the capacity of women, to empower and improve the interaction and improve the quality of education and training, and training in poor communities, to improve the participation of poverty and support of all sectors.
With regard to this initiative is a special project to assess the interventions required to deal with children under the age of 14 years.
But we all agree that the community and the poor in particular, they will not allow for co-ordinated and subsequent education - rather than likely to be necessary.
In this regard, we will require National Aramaments to the battle Against Poverty to coordinate government departments such as the Local Government, Trade and Industry, Agriculture, Forestry and Land Reforms, as well as the Department of Health and Rural Development and Land Reform, as well as the interventions necessary.
This year we will focus on the most important needs in fighting poverty in the country, we urge the inclusion of the social economy.
to promote the National Youth Service Programme including the rise of qualified people who are recognised in the National Defence Force for South African Defence Force from now 45 000.
to ensure that the Expand Public Works Programme, highly stable, demonstrated a number of young people: this will include over the number of young people trained in the programme, over 6 000 young volunteers and 1 000 young volunteers.
to contribute the imperment of products imposed by state procurement on small, medium and micro enterprises; and the Small Enterprises Development Agency create a powerful way to ensure the payment of 30 days.
We will also integrate the programme to speed up sustainable human settlements development, and intensified efforts, as a matter of urgency, speed up access, sanitation, electricity and sanitation, so that we have to reach all areas and services.
To speed up this commitment to health goal for all of us to ensure the implementation of the National HIV Strategy and AIDS Strategy (IW) we aim to ensure that the goal of health of health in all those who are not taken up to train 7,7% of the people who are not taken to train 7,7% of TB and treatment for treatment for more than 7%.
We aim to complete the work in a comprehensive social security system, benefiting from the consultations established by social partners.
Two points need to be briefly mentioned.
The first of these is the suggestion that we must swear that we will be congratulated learners and morning on the week, as well as the Youth League to showcase their lives of all the people in South Africa.
The second issue is geographic and its names, which requires a process of adhering to all provinces so that we can develop a fundamental change that we propose to implement the process that will soon be supported by the South African Geographical Names Council.
When we refer to the issue of crime in the last year, we all worried violent crime, but also for example that things have resulted in the past decline - it will be found to deepening democracy.
Accordingly, last year we engaged in business and other sectors of society, to develop a better approach to the restructuring of justice system.
In this regard, by spirit of Business Unusual, Cabinet agreed on the necessary change for the new judiciary, this approach to transforming the judiciary and transforming Police into any form of jurisdiction, including the nature of the judiciary, including the judiciary and transforming of the judiciary, the jurisdiction of the Legislature, including the judiciary and transforming Police into any other functionaldidiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the judici
As the Honourable Members have the foundation, some of these initiatives were initiated; we have hope that if everything has been done in a constructive and integrated manner, which will be more effective, the Minister will be committed to Crime Prevention.
In the course of this year, we will also launch Bills on the transformation of justice by consultation with the judges of the Magistrates, concluding the process aimed at strengthening cross border control and security, also given to the rights, and the Bill of Rights, in particular.
This is advisable by a resolution to intensify the fight against crime, as well as recommendations of the Khampepe Justice Commission on the performance of the Directorate of Special Operating Commission, which aims to improve the effectiveness of the Criminal Justice and enhance the effectiveness of this year.
This will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve governance, coordination and law enforcement agencies.
More importantly, our achievements on the day and crime depends on co-operation among us as citizens of law, inspires the rule of law, respect for the judiciary and the rights of our democracy, and in line with our Constitution.
This year we will continue efforts to improve government's performance so that we can reach citizens' obligations. When doing something, the spirit of Business Unusual will be served to the public servants.
There are simple but urgent and critical things we need to do, as part of the overall efforts to improve the capacity of the government.
Firstly, it has been agreed on all government structures so that, especially the key role players will be completed in six months, with the Department of Public Service and Administration will shape the process of monitoring these decisions.
Secondly, by May of every year (and in the beginning of the financial year in the local government) all senior managers must submit Key Performance Agreements with relevant government managers to monitor the implementation of the relevant government system.
Thirdly, recognising that the Department of Home Affairs is the cornerstone of every citizen's life annually, and we will intensify the implementation of the transformation process adopted by Cabinet as well as the ITID approach to alleviate the process of newly.
Improve performance in the public service also depends on the importance of leadership given by the administration and leadership of Executive, it is important to improve public servants in their workplace - which is directors, managers and civil union leaders.
In this regard, this year, in partnership with trade union organisations, we will call the Government Gazette to discuss issues that the spirit of Batho Pele has expressed strong views where government services are provided.
Working together with other social partners, we will ensure that, at the end of this year, the National Anti-corruption Programme is adopted, and that the agreed strategy is implemented with the local government department will establish mechanisms.
This year we will continue to strengthen efforts and capacity in the local government to correspond to the Local Government Agency 5-year-old Development Agenda. To ensure that the monitoring and evaluation of the SALGA has agreed to provide reports on the mandate.
In order to further to improve the services provided by sectors such as veterans' roots, women and youth, we will review the institutions set up to perform the necessary and monitor the necessary, including the evaluation of the government's youth development and to monitor the implementation of the government's priority.
Many challenges in our work that we have gained from weaknesses in planning., as part of our Quality Apex Priorities in the coming period ahead, which will enable government to improve government's effectiveness and efficiency.
This programme we can also outline is the commitment that our country has agreed to the leadership of the continent through the New Growth Path in Africa.
An important issue, in increasing the African Agenda this year, will be strengthening the African institutions, including the African Union and development programme, NEPAD.
This will enable us to do, encouraged by the common interests of the peoples of the continent to meet the country's agreement across all areas of Action in this regard is to collect the institutions and gathering activities in these areas.
We continue to be committed to the free trade area in the Southern African Development Community, and hope that the use of the SADC chairperson of 2008 / 029 will provide an impact on this matter.
In this regard, we will continue to engage with our partners and the European Union, on the issue of the African Union, to ensure that the negotiations in the Economic Partners are concluded with our Conference.
During the past year, we have convey our mandate of SADC to assist in the leadership of Zimbabwe's political leadership to find a solution to the challenges they face.
In short, the parties involved in discussions have reached an agreement on all matters relating to the parties must organise the matters relating to the Constitution, broadcasters and other relevant legislation, the election of the legislature, the subject to the matters, the subject to the new Constitution.
Accordingly, we will be celebrating together with the United Nations Leaders of State and Government in congratulating two parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue in which they have achieved and motivated to work together to resolve the remaining side of the African Union.
Our relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue, as we need to participate in the country's efforts to achieve peace and order to implement their development programme.
And our government will remain committed to the developments in Kenya, Chad, Burundi, Darf Darfur in Sudan, the Western Sahara, Comean, Somalia and the Central.
We are concerned about the violence and killing in Kenya and Chad, which has made progress over the past few years of renewals about the revitalization of all South Africans, helping all of us to do everything.
In fact, we will continue to make our contribution to the United Nations Security Council.
Inspired by the need to promote the improvement of the quality of life for all individuals, especially in the developing countries, we will focus on strengthening our participation in the strengthening of the India-Asia, the New Partnership of the India-Asia, and the African Union-Asia-Asia-Africa trade negotiations.
Similarly, we will continue to contribute to the achievement of the goals of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and continuing improvements in this regard, and gives perceptions to the WTO negotiations.
This year we celebrate a tenthly celebrating a diplomatic relations between South Africa and the People's Republic. China. Growth in many areas within our society and ensure that the Partnership of the Partnership and the Partnership for South Africa is a better partnership.
Next year, we will host the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the International Conference Against Racism which was held in 2001. and that we continue to re-affirm that the outcome of our people will continue to realigne the racism and ensure that we continue to re-affirm our society.
This global responsibility, including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, will lead to relief of confidence that we have in the country as a good way in all these efforts are underestimate.
I am confident that, under the leadership of the International Marketing Council, Trade and Investment South Africa (TISA), Tourism South Africa and other agencies, we will be commemorating the rest of the world's globalisation of our people in the rest of the world.
Having said what I have said, I come back to the question: what is our country when we begin!
What I know and say is: what challenges we have now, are fighting!
I say what I have felt, because I have confidence that South Africans are capable and committed to real historic challenge - to emphasise each of the past four years - including in our country's economic and social challenges, with regard to the challenges of our country, with regard to the past four years, and in our country.
While we are embrassed, and committed to managing our business in a more unusual, we will ensure the process of restructuring and sustainable development and beyond higher levels.
•ffn Ann-Chiftment.00200-01fts.
It is a pleasure to speak before the Joint Sitting of Parliament of Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, at the beginning of the last part of our first philosophy of our Democratic Parliament.
I am waiting for the people of South Africa with humility over the period that I have had a high level of trafficking in the country's abuser prevailing democracy from the previous State led by the former President.
For me it is a responsibility, on the issue of a few months, to lead the National Council of Provinces to finalise the mandate of the National Congress in 2004, and to laid the basis behind the election process.
That for the past five months, we have been able to ensure that there are untoubted changes in the administration of our government as a result of our past five years of our democratic and co-operation of the Executive Council.
Looking back over the past decade, I would like to acknowledge and harder of President Thabo Hbe and Mbeki and many women play under the leadership of the African Union; to play a role in the leading of all three major role in the South African continent.
In all of this, I stand by celebrating all of you, with confidence that South Africa we celebrate today - the world has been divided, problems and experienced in the past 15 years - and the result of South African women and men.
South Africans representing belief and openness that is the characteristics of our country.
In the quantity of South Africans to have our Members of our democracy we have a tragedy with them from the previous February, including the Banrick, Korean, Korean, Lulge, Londorie Walter, Korehge, Londorie.
In them, I wish to extend the Ms Helen Suzman, a special South African, representing the values of our new Parliament in the previous lies.
We also need some of those whose homes sharing friends to be served as we know that we have no economic profile, even if we are visiting political change in our country.
However, we should not underestimate the challenges we face. Focusing of the world economy to create high-risk poverty for inequality and social groups in our society.
Naturally, there is a lack of political alliance may cause many questions that do not have answers to the present.
For that reason, some of us can be surprising vibo-economic heritage and will boost our approach to the economic crisis.
But our country is a journey of confidence and selfity.
We may say, in the unusual situation, many of our Constitution have lagotten in the moment; and all of this examination indicates democracy.
Our democracy is healthy. Newly sustainable, is underestimated by the Constitution that has not been aligned to the world.
In reality, hard work in our discussions during the era of democracy - which we all agreed that we must have a democracy and freedom - is a promise to enhance democracy and democracy.
It is the people of South Africa that can guarantee continuity; and we will also defend our democracy in the coming years.
Allow me, Madam Speaker and Chairperson, for the purposes of appeal to all South Africans who have to register and vote in the next two regional and regional elections, so that we can shape our own future.
This we must do every day working at municipal offices, before the election of the voters'll.
I want to take time when I took out that in the next few days, I will conclude with the Judiciary and the Presidential Youth Commission, to inform the day of the elections.
We extend our gratitude as democracy to all South Africans, in April 1994, to all of us all take their future into our hands.
It is an easy task but the importance of opting for the people of our country, we have pointed out demands for all our humanity.
It is therefore necessary to celebrate the celebration of 20 Years of approval of the Ordinary Ordinary Committee on the South African Qualifications which was adopted in August 1989, as set out.
Strategies have made the basis for the global agreement, with the International Union, in particular discussions in South Africa.
In South Africa, it also has also made a conversent of the 1989 Conference of Democratic Future - to integrate various social partners.
All this led to the negotiations in our first democratic election in 1994.
In this regard, we must show the honour to the President of the African National Congress, Oliver Reliver Tambo, initiated this throughout the country and the international community, with international debt of our country.
That process of engagement is a framework for peacekeeping and reconciliation, in the and conflict, resulted in a positive and bad and worstruction in the past 160 Conference of the United Nations (NRC).
If the Conference defined the borders of the South African values we know today, it is not placed under apartheid and separated.
So, 15 years in our democracy, we can begin to review the fear, unambiguous and uncertainties over 100 years of distinguish between our democracy, and alleviate the abuse of some women, but it is not only be a pity.
In this respect and the lack of protection has given the rise of a year of proud.
Allow me to acknowledge Lucas Mahlangu, brother Soon, who represents the family of Mahlangu.
Solomon Mahlangu was continuing the trend of the past five years, who saw the under Germs Chryodium 187 who came to win the struggle against our own democracy.
Thirteen years of friends and thirty (130) to continue, we can respond to the conviction that exist in those areas.
Between education, mutual respect, the common interest in many young people falling during the struggle to trafficking the dawn of freedom and leaders of adult.
A student group from the NUSAS to begin the South African Student Association (Sool) 40 years ago.
For all these people there were first Saso, who include Strineley, Korean, Porge, Steward, Barge Park, Prinkage, Prinkage Parkge, Prinkage.
In this regard, we also honour the Ephra Ephra Ephrage President Mogale, the first 30 years of the South African Student Association (CA), and his peer.
By rememorating the student of yesterday there is a message that was rejected, that the legitimate of freedom and experience even though our youth.
The epidemic in their holistically enthusiasm cease today as it was the past few years, that we should lead to a leading the spirit of Freedom Charter (F).
We invite these organisations and its leaders to emphasize the spirit of believing and affirming democracy in fighting liberation while all these obstacles are uncertain; unevable; the responsibility that our expression in many perspectives.
And so, Madam Speaker and Chairperson of the Honourable Chairperson, we must ask ourselves: what steps have been described in transforming the democratic Constitution of the Republic of South Africa for the past five years of our democracy;
Today we have a democratic system that serves, which is placed in the principles of transparency, and multilateral institutions to engage with citizens and institutions supporting the democratic Constitution.
Over the past decade, we have improved the levels of management by young people. We have improved the system of government communication in all spheres of government, improved coordination and its interaction.
Indeed, government can be proud that we have changed the nature of government's performance, which relate to our national features.
However, while women do about 34% of higher levels in public employment, which is under the equity that we had set.
At the national level and provincial legislatures, for instance, it is that the national government will be more than 32% women representation at the level to 2004 and hope that 40% of the local government elections.
We hope that all political parties, while completing its election, will participate in these good initiatives!
With the progress they have been made, 0,2%, the situation is particularly unsatisfied by the disabled to be employed in government, comparisoning 2% that we have set ourselves.
To count on all of us, the private sector remains behind.
Specific proposals have been set to improve the effectiveness of the public service, including the financial management, Centres and other Thusong, to improve the performance of government, and to improve governance of the Departments.
However, there is still much more needs to be done to improve the service and to educate performance in some public servants, especially those who are faces with citizens in their public service.
As the Honourable Members know, our government has prioritised corruption as a major objective.
This enshrined in the principles and regulatory regulating public servants and politicians who have arrest intergovernmental relations, social and social partners, as well as telephone lines of corruption.
It may be that maladministration and alleviation of corruption is lacking; but from the perspective of government, we can say that over 70% of the Criminal actions reported to the public because government has acquired alcohol and corruption.
Such challenges exist in the private sector, the challenge is under control; there is a matter of enforcement.
I know that we all agreed to a better life for our citizens, especially in this country can generate the generation of national wealth and ensure that the benefits of all the economy are divided.
It is normally, after economic stagnation in the 1980s and 1990, South Africa has grown substantially economic growth since 1994.
During the first decade of Freedom, the economic growth of average of 3% per annum, and the improvement of 5% in 2004 to 5% in 2007.
While increasing employment, employment and income price increase, income levels, employment and social wage, it has taken a leading to sustainable growth opportunities.
This includes, at the beginning, the high rate of investment and private sector investment, over the past five years, we had invested in the Gross GDP (GDP).
This is part of government's programme results to expand public infrastructure.
It is a result of the policies to improve the level of investment in the private sector; and to make a fiscal policy more realising employment and reduce the impact of inflation while promoting economic and social sustainability.
The aim of the larger economic transformation over the past decade, and efforts, especially from 2004 was removed from obstacles to sustainable growth.
In this regard, efforts to Shalose Growth and Shared Growth and Shared (ASA) initiative), ensure that all obstacles to sustainable infrastructure such as infrastructure, policy, is the challenge of effective implementation, coordination and effective programmes, and the challenge of government.
Our economy is open, and since 1994 is stabilised in our global financial system.
But, its accessibility to the residents of our society is still under the expectations of our economy, our global trade and foreign trade, particularly the sector of growth, particularly the sector.
Because of this, the rate of globalisation and international trade has not been ratioled with other countries.
And because of the weaker savings rate, we have had a lack of financial impact on investment programmes.
These are the challenges our country will face to continue.
More importantly, is the question: what is the economic growth of the Treatment to be done to improve the lives of people?
Therefore, the question is whether other growth remains balance and unity can face the economy.
More importantly, sharing the benefits of growth must include the labour force, ensuring fair employment.
It is, in fact, a question of salt that between 1995 and 2003, the economy created about millions of new jobs; and at least 500 per annum between 2004 and the year and only half of 000 jobs between 2004 and the year.
At the last time, it is the first step since the gain of democracy, creating more than the first unemployment rate, which has reduced unemployment rate from 31% in 2007.
It is true, this should not remove our promises to continue to review the issue of employment equity, including the rights and benefits they can enjoy.
To share the benefits of growth including the launch of the employment redress employment reforms were excluded, including Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment.
This is not in line with the racial agenda, in fact, unsounded country's participation at all levels of economic activity that will work high.
The fact that the private sector is lagging behind the state of regulatory and capacity, in business development and other sectors in our country to grow.
To share the benefits of growth means sustainable employment and equity in government through public disposal and sharing the burden of public service delivery.
Nonetheless, honour members will know that more data on the issue related to the wage of civil society, I will mention some examples of the natural resource progress we have experienced.
Government is aware that there is growing poverty in our country; and the level of inequality is high.
Over the past 15 years we have done much better than we can attack this by providing social assistance.
Firstly, the level of income poverty alleviation from poverty alleviation while alleviating alleviation of poverty eradication of poverty, inequality has increased significantly while alleviation of poverty alleviation while alleviation of poverty alleviation while alleviation of poverty alleviation of poverty alleviation while alleviation of poverty alleviation while alleviation of poverty alleviation as permits has increased significantly relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly poorly significantly poorly poorly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly significantly decline.
In the households that include children (incluined as aged 17 and 17), the proportion of households reported that children under the age of poverty has declined significantly significantly toperive poverty from 31 percent (including over the age of 55 percent in 2006.) have improved the poor.
In reality, this view is tiyisisiwafied by our research, which shows that the millions of South African citizens and Coloureds have declined, resulted in the result of 2008, the amount of job seekers have increased to reach a total of 125 million in 1994.
This happens because of the Promotion of Access to Child Assistance, rising from 34 million beneficiaries in 2008.
As part of providing poor salaries, the target rate of unemployment by the Expanded Public Works Programme was achieved in 2008, the year before the commencement of the programme had taken place since 2004.
In the issue of access to basic services by households, the number of speaks for themselves.g. access to water has improved from 62% in 1996 to 88% in 2008 and 78% in electricity; (5% to 72% in electricity; (5% to 72%).
Evaluating the income of the country's earnings best to improve access to health facilities. 95% of South African people live in 54 kilometres of water and all households have increased access to the quality of water and has increased from 85% of the nursetre; and all the nutrition has increased.
It also gives us emphasis that HIV research shows falling and decline in the infection rate.
In addition, the treatment of anti anti anti anti anti anti anti anti antiretroviral programme was only high in the world, but increased during treatment, over 60 000 patients had begun.
But health facilities do not have always medicines, and enough staff, and the provision of water and electricity. For other resources, the management is untrutably stable with opinion to be improved.
In education, we see the underverage teacher performance and a student; a full achievement by school enrolment at school level; and better than the number of children passing meat and nutrition.
At the same time, we tried to improve infrastructure in poor areas.
Of course we know that there are those who leave school and classrooms and higher schools, which is not acceptable, and the education system has not yet produced the necessary skills.
In addition, the process of performance, all in terms of composition and learning, highlighting the matter of concern for the past.
Sadly, where education is much needed to help eradicate poverty, with limited resources, management and number of teachers.
Special programmes of government in its citizens have also been built to assist poor, for housing have been allocated 2,6 million.
We must acknowledge that the issue of land reform programme as well as stabilisation after new accommodation should be made soon as reasonably possible.
In general, we are proud of the continuity of social programmes.
In education, health, housing, sanitation, water and sanitation, the most important question we face is where we can improve the quality of these work materials!
The violent crime is still a source of lack of protection for South Africans, Experience and daily, on poverty and inequality such as poverty, etc in a negative attack.
In the organization of state and the private sector, bad alleviate Schemes is a matter of concern.
It is true, the total proportion of crime, which is based on 2002, has grown down all Stats stated in this.
But we know that this decline has not grown rapidly, and almost 7-10% that we have set ourselves in crime levels, that the violent crime is that the violent violent crime and violently violently violently violently violent crime;
This indicates the lack of power in our areas, especially in the building of technical and we will assist in resolving crime and showcase criminal justice system, to investigate the effectiveness of crime and efficiency of all our police institutions.
These are matters which criminal justice system can commence and preparing it.
But, when we are alcohol, we should not lose the fact that we review the current procedure, which is illegranted by our country.
This is a matter that these changes exist in these organisations, in terms of its basic values and principles to the culture of human rights, its structure and its administration.
But let us not condemn: as our whole lives, that amendment is still in the early stage.
I know that honourable Members will agree with me that in our democratic moment we have to find a meaningful expectations where we are looking at vulnerable.
In this regard, by international law, international law, control and tourists confirmed efforts to improve children's conditions, women and old.
Thanks to campaigns and the outcome of our partnerships we have gained partnership and institutions representing marginalised groups, we have improved the impact on this matter; and encourage the development of the priority.
It is a matter of record of pride, for example, families, priority by women have received a high level of social assistance including housing and health care; and to programmes that are successfully planned for the development of nutrition and well-being of children.
But to achieve high unemployment in rural women, young people and HIV infantly affects young women and children and higher.
All these work has been allocated for the future.
These are some of the signs that have been brought by democracy; and the success of government has made available to meet the electoral mandate.
There is no objection that, with measuring, progress has been made since 1994 no surprise that there are no doubt that these challenges are still many.
But I have gone a long journey for freedom. I did not succeed; I have taken a long journey, as I have got that I got that I had a long shock, as I have got there.
In some months now people will announce the leadership they would like to continue this good work of a vibrant and other people have begun our democracy.
While our global perceptions are different, the goals we have seen obviously where it can be enshrined in our Constitution: creating a prosperous, non-racial, non-sexist democratic, non-racial and non-sexist democratic society.
Six years ago, our people joined our Summit to Peace and Development Summit and agreed on the work we have to do to improve the lives of South Africans, especially to alleviate poverty and reduce poverty by 2014.
home action and implement development, including resources and access to basic services.
I believe that, as part of this, the goals in which South Africa depends on the improvement of education; adequate provision of health care, well-being; strengthening rural development and social security; to ensure a better nutrition; and strengthening rural and social security;
I quote these issues because they are empowered or familiarising or will make it all national police civic society, I have chosen to make such a matter of emphasis that South Africans are not suffering our view to transform the poor.
This perspectives are accompanied by all human, in which highlighted in the Millennium Development Goals.
Again, today it is faced with a risk that the objectives set out in the recent years, if not the age of age, it is the result of the economy attacks the whole economy.
What, then, is the first financial crisis in the non-profit organisations, and the price for products and trade.
We can restructuring, well-being of senior managers, i.e. we can relocate government policies that will take place at the cost of their journey and allows for unauthorised markets.
But our mid-term work is to acknowledge the outcome of these developments in our country and country's economy, there will also show their impact on these areas in our society.
This is why our country's regulatory environment and stadium policy policies that we have to help stop this negative impact.
But we all know that, due to the global economic integration, and the need for international trade and employment, to achieve finance and financial incentives that have been transformed into unjust economic growth; and
These difficulties are accompanied during inflation and interest rates are high.
Consequently, the development of this fund that we need to expand infrastructure provision and implementation of our infrastructure projects.
We know with us that South Africa is relatively small, compared with other countries, at the time of the economy of South Africa's economy, and the country's lowest growing economy, even if the lowest growth rate.
In this respect, honourable Members, I am happy to report that in consultation with the Presidency and the leaders of different stakeholders, we have agreed to integrate the social partners that will reduce our emphasis.
Firstly, government will continue with government's investment projects, the value of this increase to R90 billion over the next three years, where necessary, we will recover money.
This will include support through financial and monetary union institutions to come from the international agency, with a partnership with the private sector and resources that regulates such as pension.
Secondly, we will intensify employment programmes in some sectors, we plan to increase employment equity in such as health, labour, social workers and the Expanded Public Works Programme, and further to speed up the following Expanded Public Works.
Thirdly, legal steps can be implemented in the private sector to underestimate higher investment and liquidation or industrial liquidation.
On its part, government will implement industrial finance and the instrument to assist with the challenges in different sectors, and encourage the development of industries to help sharing these industries.
Together it can help, it is a long-term holidays, increasing training, short-term work.
Fourthly, government will undertake and expanding the expenditure of the nation, including increased access to child grant for 18 and reducing the age of social grant for 60 years.
In addition, we will intensify the Expanded Public Works Programme (No Reb Consumption) and the price of food security especially those who are victims of the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
We will continue to focus on the challenges of negotiating misconduct for some business in this way, we wish to thank the Competition Commission showing that they will be held.
We hope that the social union will continue to strive for this and ensure, in some, that the price is understood by society.

The nation will recall that during the State of the Nation Address, I announced that the Expanded Public Works Programme will create 500 seats in December 2009.
These work opportunities have provided unemployed people, experience and duration of training.
We are pleased to announce that in December, we have created more than 480 000 work opportunities in government, which is 97% that we had set ourselves to ensure that these local suppliers and industrial infrastructure projects.
We know that this and other initiatives will not help to fight the recession. We wish the spirit of family work, the community has a voluntary work that encourages many people who are involved in this struggle.
Economic indicators say that we are on the best track.
Economic activities of the South African economy, and we expect growth, while continuing work Statistics, released Tuesday, show that the economy is already creating continuing to alleviate poverty, while reducing unemployment.
Our programme of our infrastructure programme will help us grow rapidly. Our education and skills development programmes will increase productivity and competition.

This includes home resources and home-based projects and literacy and numeracy, home care, efforts to foster schools and early childhood development.
Last year we launched the National Youth Development Agency.
Develop its blows, throughout the country, so that it will prioritise youth development programmes within government.
As this government begins to govern itself, we have promised to work hard to build a new society, we have said that the country responds to the needs and the people of the year, and will act quickly, as soon as possible.
The characteristics of this government will be that you know where people live, understands their needs and responds quickly.
Government must act quickly, strength and intelligence.
We will look forward to Governments and Public Works to follow this vision.
We build a society based on performance, in order to improve planning and review and performance review. We also need to strengthen gender equity in the Government Anti-Makist Programmes, ensuring that women have access to development opportunities.
We are pleased to announce a new way of doing things in government.
The work of the departments will be measured by outcomes, developed by the performance review systems and assess the performance of our performance.
The ministers responsible for particular outcome, will sign an agreement with the President's performance agreement. The Accord which must be made, how it will be done, by whom, during the time determined and utilisation of any resources.
As you know, we have committed to five targets: education, health, rural development and land reform, creating decent work, fight crime.
In addition, we will work towards improving the performance of local government, infrastructure development and social stability.
We will be committed to a number of main activities to achieving these results.
We have put education and skills development within government policies.
In our 2010 programme, we wish to improve our children's ability to read, write and count on the foundation.
If we do not do this, we will not improve the quality of education. our educational goals is but it is essential.
We want learners and teachers to be in school, class, during time, learning and teaching for seven hours a day.
We will help teachers to provide the educative education plans with information. Please, we will provide workbooks for all languages since this year, with literacy and literacy of literacy and literacy rates.

We must invest in our youth to ensure efficient labour to support growth and job creation.
We therefore propose to increase the training of 16-25 in more education and training infrastructure, which will enable us to provide a second educative education scheme, who did not qualify for universities and that are eligible to ensure that all eligible studies are met.
We also set targets which we wish to achieve skills development, producing technical politicians, and increasing the number of qualified Mathematics and Science teachers.
We must also increase the number of young people who are involved in independent and public institutions.
Another result is to ensure that all South Africans have a better life. We will continue to improve health care, infrastructure and improve hospitals and well-being (BDF) and improve co-operation and improve hospitals and improve the effectiveness of the health and efficiency of the Sectors and well as well-operation (BDB) and improve the implementation of the health and improve the implementation of the infrastructure programme.

With cooperation we can stop crime.
The Local Government has to work. Municipalities to improve housing, sanitation, electricity, water treatment and roads has also taken place a meeting with district municipalities who have been allocated to the mainly in Mpumalanga.
A number of issues have already been considered. Nzimkulu ministers to deal with issues remained by the Agency, although there is no co-operatives, it has also been dealt with in the spirit of Classment and the Leadership in December.
This will ensure that local government has the management, administration and capacity required to perform the function.

We implement programmes like programmes in some sites around the country, benefiting 21 wards for 2014, we aim to have sites around 160 wards. We need 60% of households to meet their food security needs by 2014.
Small-scale will be the right, as much as being said, small things begin.
We also want to integrate land reform and agricultural reform and agricultural reform programmes. Our industrialisation will be limited to the number of black farmers or minerals to emerge the economy.
Our country has not fallen when it comes to water.
But, we still lose more water through rehabilitation of pipes and inadequate infrastructure. We will set a number of steps to lose water loss by half by 2014.
As part of our country's efforts to encourage economic growth, we are working to reduce the cost of communication. South African broadband can also expect re reduction of alternative technologies (inclusive technologies), as well as telephone, and other technologies.
This government will ensure that our environmental assets and natural resources are protected, and it is renewable regularly.
Neither with Brazil, India and China, as well as the United States, which represents the developed countries, we contribute a major contribution to the adoption of the Convention on Climate Change as is necessary.

We need a high level of work and hard work. We need public servants, capable and maintaining public needs. Government is now working with developing and implementing all government policies and standards that will set out in all spheres of government.
We continue to efforts to eradicate corruption and fraud in the process of hand-over state-owned government, and in the applications for driver's driving licence, social grants, many instances, which are in favour of the Portfolio Committee.
In partnership, together we can achieve more.
As we know, we have begun the Presidential Hotline to enable government and the Presidency to deliver on flexibility, and help resolving these barriers were in place for service delivery to make a difference in our diversity.
We cannot say Mr Buziwe Nuleka Mount Fount Fount Franre, who was calling on the retired her husband, who wishes to start his first working day.
He has also flen this evening. We also also had Mr Nkululeko Cele, who has helped his identity document, which will help him enrol in Tshwane University of Technology.

On 22nd of April, millions of South Africans were out of choice. They have taken their right to be encouraged to alter their lives.
With their high rates, they have confirmed that working together we can do more to fight poverty and create better life for all.
They are encouraged by a vision of inclusive society, South Africa that belongs to all, a racial and unity among its citizens, working together to all of them.
We are very concerned about this electoral mandate given by the people of our country, who have chosen their government in a undoubtedly.
Our nation, in the past few years, has experienced a serious challenges.
In this regard, we have a strong and democratic functional of democracy, and institutions, that we have managed to overcome this difficulty with dignity and dignity.
Today's work is to celebrate what makes this democracy work. It also celebrates our culture for continuing and accountable collective responsibility.
This also has proof of the existence of our icon Madiba, who has laid the foundation for a nation, and the existence of President Thabo Mbeki, who built on that basis.
Further progress has also been made with the fact that former President Kgalema Motlanthe is now the Deputy President of the Republic, after many of this transition, and in many respects.
As you can be aware, the fight against poverty remains one of our focus.
We cannot, and we will never dwel ourselves, in our fight against poverty.
To achieve these goals, our government has chosen 10 priorities, which is part of the Germanent Strategic Framework for 2009 to 2014.
This programme is being initiated under difficult economic conditions.
The past year has saw the global economy over the past of the crisis has never been in the past decade.
While South Africa is not affected by this way the number of other countries affected, its present implications are increasingly seen in our economy, we have also affected the impact of the economy.
It is important now more than ever before we work together in the same programme to have a response to this crisis.
We regard as our first place of the South African response to the global economic crisis, which has been achieved by government, labour and business in February this year, we must take action to reduce the impact of the current vulnerable.
We have begun to work to reduce the loss of unemployment. There is consensus between government and state-owned enterprises to initiate the process of training.
These workers will be faced with dismissal as a result of the economic problems will be displayed in a particular time and the ability once again.
The discussion of the process of continuing interaction between people who work with these areas will be affected by this initiative, including the Sector Education and Training.
We will support the work of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to assist employers and workers to find otherwise without delay in terms of relevant legal procedures.
To date, CCMA commissioners have saved more than four thousand jobs through facilitation processes, and give advice and support workers who have been postponed.
The Small Enterprise Development Corporation has begun the programme to provide finance to the most vulnerable companies.
Building on the successes of our industrial policy interventions, the Industrial Policy Action Plan will be introduced.
Priority areas that have been selected are transport, chemicals, tourism, clothing and textiles, as well as forestry, and expansion, with regard to innovation, facilitation of innovation and innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation, facilitation of innovation, facilitation of innovation and development.
As part of Phase 2 of the Expanded Public Works Programme, the Public Works Programme will be speeded up.
It provides a minimum level of regular work to those who need, while improving the quality of life to the community.
Economic growth will affect the speed that our country can address the social and economic challenges our country faces.
The priorities that we have identified, and plans we put before the voters, remain at the heart of this government programme.
In the spirit of South African citizens, let us embrace our hands to find solutions to the time they come to work hard.
Our government will look forward, not later!
The steps outlined in our Medium Term Strategic Framework Strategic Framework must take into account which is maintained by the economic crisis, Decentralisation should not make these plans effective.
The framework focuses on 10 priorities.
We decides that work together to speed up economic growth and transforming economic and sustainable livelihoods.
We will begin the programme to build economic and social infrastructure. We will begin and implement a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land reform and food security.
We will strengthen the capacity and capacity of staff. We will improve the health profile of all South Africans.
Working together with all South Africans, we will intensify the fight against crime and corruption. We will build cohesive, sustainable and sustainable communities.
Working together with Africa and the rest of the world, we will need to find a way to continue to co-operate with international trade.
We will ensure proper regulatory and sustainable use of resources.
Also, in partnership with the people and supported by our public servants, we will build a developmental, improved social services and strengthening democratic institutions.
It is a pleasure and honour for me to highlight the key elements of our programme to work.
The creation of good work will be at the heart of our economic performance.
In line with our beliefs, we need to shift in promoting inclusive economy.
In this regard, we will utilise all government mechanisms such as procurement, licensing and financial support to assist small business, including increasing the implementation of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment strategy.
Expenditure will be done in recognition the need to redress the past.
Transforming will be brought to support women, youth and persons with disabilities.
We will reduce the burden of control on small businesses. The case ofmbele by regulations have been mentioned in several occasions.
In some intervention to create an environment that enables investment to take place, government will focus on one integrated business registration system.
This will improve customer services and reduce the cost of doing business in South Africa.
Another key element of our drive to create employment opportunities is the Expanded Public Works Programme.
The second phase of the programme aims to create four million work opportunities by 2014.
Between now and December 2009, we plan to create about 500 000 work opportunities.
While we are creating decent work environment and business opportunities, government ensures that some citizens continue to be helped with government grants to eliminate poverty.
We recognise the need to integrate social grants and economic or economic activity to encourage self-employed people.
More importantly at this time, neighbours need to help each other.
Now is the time of engagement. Let us help ourselves.
Let us hope that there should not be a child who will suffer from hungry because of his parents did not work together, we can do more.
Distinguished guests, as part of this strategy before we continue our programme to build economic and social infrastructure.
This group is still developing the National Infrastructure Development Strategies will ensure that the R877 billion to be used for infrastructure as set out earlier this year is well implemented.
This money includes the provision of housing for the programme to build schools, transport including the state-owned Transport system, housing, water and sanitation.
One of the major foreign investment projects in the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, strengthened government as a nation as a whole that the World Cup will benefit from our children and our country.

We are stabilising all systems to make the World Cup begins with 4 June, a bigger success.

We are committed to providing more time to address the concerns of the taxi industry effectively. 11 June of Transport will commence with this business.
The meeting will initiate a series of consultation with those who are affected by the BRT system.W confidence that these matters will not be dealt with and satisfied with all parties involved.
This will include the key issues that all those affected will benefit from these efforts.
Another development that must help the World Cup is the launch of digital broadcasting and broadcasting of broadcasting power.
In all, we will ensure that the cost of telecommunications is reduced through broadcast projects under way to boost broadband capacity.
We must ensure that we have not left rural areas behind stimulating developments.
As part of the development of human resource development we will provide sustainable housing to the poor and cost effective human settlements.
We will continue to understand that human settlement is only the construction of housing.
It is a matter of transforming our cities and building cohesive and cohesive communities, sustainable and sustainable communities and community infrastructure, including sport and recreation.
In this spirit, we will work with Parliament to speed up the processing of the Land Use Management Bill.
Working together with our people in rural areas, we will ensure a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land reform and the security and third priority.
I should like to use this opportunity to extend our condolences with the family of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Dirk du Toit, who passed the late last week since her contribution will be remembered.
People in rural areas also have the right to electricity and water, sanitation, roads, sport and recreation; including selling posts such as urbanisation.
They also have the right to assistance in agriculture so that they can grow vegetables and other things; and so that animals can feed themselves.
We are committed to launch this campaign to build rural areas. We are partnership with civil society, councillors and principals to speed up this work.
We urge rural people to start preparing to tell us what things they need, working together we can do more.

In addition, we will work towards the selected rural urban revisements, through grants such as the Rural Development and Land Reform, informal settlements around the towns benefit of the economy.
With all these interventions, we are faced with a structural change in our country.
Education will be a key priority for the next five years. We need our teachers, learners and parents to turn our schools into higher centres.
The Expanded Public Works Programme will be promoted in the same achievingments for Grade R and increasing the number of 114 per annum by 2014.
We reiterate these things that cannot negotiate. Teachers have to be in school, educate, teaching, learning, teaching, teaching, child work and teaching of their children and teaching, teaching, teaching, teaching, teaching, teaching, etc.
To improve school management, formal training will be a prerequisite for promoting teachers to principals and heads of department.
I will interact with principals to share our vision in the review of our education system.
We will increase our efforts to encourage learners to complete their secondary education.
The target is to increase the number of enrolments in secondary schools to 95 percent in 2014. we also look at ways to restore school children, and provide support.

Water managers will not take the necessary decisions on the wrong information or not enough information.
Although the Department is not sitting to observe the sources of water, Im 4 of the National Water Act is prevailing that the implementation of appropriate monitoring and evaluation of all sources of water.
The National Water Resource Strategy will enable this work in two ways; expanding existing inspections in the country and develop and improve the provision of information.
The department has an ongoing role to assess the quality of water in the country, with regard to high or under land, but the work needs to be broadened so that such as fireworthy and other sources of fire, which may be kept in the quantity.

It is a matter that is acceptable that people learn in particular and act.e. account is above the employer, with the leadership of government departments (the ministerss) and all the relevant political body, to ensure that all political and accountable government's leadership are set up in all norms and standards.
Section 195 (a) of the Constitution indicates that "the high level conduct in the workplace is monitored in general public servants, to ensure that the Coordination of Conduct for all employees is required to ensure that the Coordination of Conduct for all employees is in the Public Service and the Coordination of Conduct.
It is important to emphasise that the purpose of the jurisdiction of the Code of Conduct, namely the Code of Conduct, for instance, the employee will be guilty of the Code of Conduct, as amended by section 18, subject to any regulation, subject to the provisions of the Public Service.
An employee should be honoured in the country and respect the constitution, also obliged to monitor this in his or her working days.
Reference to "Tiko" in terms of the definition that operates by individuals, must state every general state in South Africa. it is a prerequisite for all public servants to be honest to their country.
The Constitution of the country looks at certain aspects relating to the rights and rights and interests of the first, the Code of Conduct means that the public servants are honoured in the second democratic and second democratic process must be recognised as a whole.
Example 1: Public servants in the different categories of participation or oversight, to contribute to the legislation.g. any suggestions must be monitored to ensure that it does not comply with the provisions of the Constitution or any other sections of the Constitution or any other institution, including the completion of the Constitution.
Example 2: Section 33 of the Constitution says that everyone whose rights have been adversely affected by government's labour, has the right to be written or affiliated, stating that it means that everyone acting in the Constitution, must swear or affirm that any other institution or affirm that it is necessary.
An employee should also prioritise the needs of the public as she serves his or her duties.
This means that when deciding or decision-making, first steps must be taken into account the needs of the public servant or any other institution that is necessary to provide for the interests of the public.
Example 1: An employee preparatory work where the damage of the hospital was born by his or her work contract to work from 800:00 to 16:00 if he or she does not comply with the deadline.
Example 2: The majority of staff working in the regional office indicate the desire to take their working days in December. When all employees are allowed, it means that the office will be inappropriate and that the necessary service is necessary.
An employee must perform his or her duties in accordance with the provisions of the existing government legislation, if he or her official duties as prescribed by national legislation.
An Act of Rights in the Constitution, protects the rights of individuals in Political, which includes the right to consultation or administer the political party, which is in favour of the Public Service, and that it may be implied with the interests of the Public Service.
Example 1: A public servant confident that health care would be an important matter in national legislation, also supports the political party that is the same with Government, that is imperative that it is necessary to give people an impact.
Example 2: If the existing government wants to create certain jobs, and it is in the hands of the public servant reminds what is best practice, the employee wants to do, whether he or she has to set aside his or her behaviour, he or her best, he or she should also be prejudiced, he or she should be served to look at the best, he or she should be in any unjudice.
An employee should also know and comply with all the rules and orders contained in his or her performance.
In order to perform the existing government and the country by honest and efficient, employees need to know what they are doing, the rules that manage their work and how to perform.
Leaders should be accountable to ensure that employees are familiar with what they should do. their employees are accountable to know what they are doing, and the ability to comply with the principles set up in their communities, they will also serve.
Example 1: Not to be aware of the financial sector, the employee may allow for the purchasing of any other property without the approval from the Department of Water Affairs, Forestry and Fisheries means that any unauthorised and unauthorised incentives and unlawfully deplies unlawfully deregulated.
Example 2: With regard to the employee who has no knowledge, he or she can provide the person with the fact that the person applying for a grant for older persons resilied such as the requirements, the application process may be necessary for a refugee or a refugee benefits.
An employee must co-operate with sections established in terms of legislation and the Constitution of the Republic, if he or she serves the citizen.
There are a number of sections established under the Constitution, the Public Protector, Auditor-General, the Public Service Commission, gender equity, etc), and that these may be established by national legislation, subject to any recommendations.
Example 1: When the Public Protector is requested to review a complaint received by a member of the public, an employee's office, it will look forward to consultation with the department to give any information required.
Example 2: Once the Auditor-General finds the performance of corruption in the performance of the department, the internal staff are not necessary to clean this research as the Operational Operational Operations must also understand the importance of managers and the department.
South Africa while working on his official duties.
Building a cohesive and democratic South Africa that will be able to take its position as a whole country between other countries.
In order to achieve and maintain the provisions made in the national Constitution, there must be a dedication to the theme of all the Public servants, the public servants must be considered as part of government, to consider this matter.
Example 1: Found Co-operation, friendship, friendship and restructuring of good working environment between different working groups and co-operate with the South African citizens, will make a good example to a broader community plays.
Example 2: A public servant should try to enrol at least one of the official languages used in the area where he or she works. He or she must also be rejected to transform any other relevant languages at the meeting.
A public servant will be served on a separate basis, and is entirely to be honest to create confidence in the public service.
Public employment serves all citizens, and the public serves equally, efficiently, efficiently and effectively, efficiently and efficiently, and in a manner that has to acknowledge the importance of colleagues should take into account the fact that the importance of partnership.
Example 1: An employee works in the department where certain service requests are made by the citizen. An employee recognises that the employee may collect the service necessary, and help him or her or herself or herself or herself in his or her or her or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself
Example 2: An employee should request the people he or she serves to disclose any queue for assistance if his or her term expires his or her interest, favour or prejudice.
An employee should be humility, helpful and immediately if co-operation with the Public Service, also treat people as customers who are entitled to high level of service.
It is important for employees to ensure that they enter into the public service, they have committed themselves to perform the nation effectively.
People expect the public to be served, which requires employees to be served and efficiently and effectively.
Example 1: An employee is condemned by a member of the public, but if he or she receives a complaint, it is clear that it is not in the public sector or any other department easily investigating the employee, he or she should be given a separate application, but the employee should also be given the varieties from the supervisor.
Example 2: If an employee serves the counter, but no one may be footing in his or her own counterparts, he or she does not only represent the counterfeit for the counterfeit of the counterfelling of his or her counterfeiting.
Example 3: If a member of the country specifies the public servant, for instance, access to information on the needs of the person is able to be given a home by the state, the employee should immediately give him or herself or herself as soon as reasonably possible, he or she is required to help him or her or her or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself or herself.
An employee has an objection to the circumstances and concerns of the public as he or she becomes working officially with his or her official duties, and if he or she does not affect them.
Despite the needs or concerns of the progression of the public, it may seem to be powerful as a member of the public thinks, labour force must be directed to assist them with the ability to provide the best possible solutions to problems.
Following the complaint by one or more people must be considered.g. consultation with other employee to lodge its complaint with complaints, they can contribute to the conditions of the public service.
Example 1: There may be plans to build a clinic in rural communities, but in turn, the department may be able to carry out the services of the Department to ensure that the community has been fully involved.
Example 2: A public servant should apply for housing subsidies for disadvantaged communities and are permanently unfit for all individuals and are served as soon as possible.
An employee is committed to performing his or her duties effectively when developing and promoting the state of all South African citizens.
The existing government, has expressed its intention to promote the conditions of the previously disadvantaged communities, as set out in the development programmes and development of their departments need to perform their functions.
South Africa is a country in the developing and most citizens, for the reasons, do not know the rights, obligations, obligations, the necessary services, relevant legislation, necessary to consult with the general public, to consult with regard to any information.
This must be done in a manner to show love and competent, even if it means that he or she refers to another sector, department or building.
Example 1: Employees should participate in development programmes or upgrading existing public participation programmes within their departments, and must be involved in their work and ensure that these programmes are efficient, efficiently and effectively planned.
Example 2: When the staff work with the public in the workplace health care, employees should use the opportunity to give full advice if they think the information that the public is not entitled to the affairs of their employees are not eligible.
An employee should not be discriminating against a member of the country in terms of language, gender, ethnic or social origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, age, disability, religion, belief or culture.
As mentioned above, the public service serves all individuals and their communities, it is not complied with anyone's public servants, and that they have the right to be served by the citizens, the public is entitled to be served by the public.
Example 1: An employee may imagine that a member of the public who wants to be served, a man who wishes to be married to a co-operate with his or her official act as if the employee is not necessary, in any case of any unity.
Example 2: There are many people who were in footing the line, and will succeed in motivate an employee who wishes to walk his or her emergency and immediately and if the employee receives the help.
An employee may have to use his or her position in the unexpectedly in the public service, promote or maintain any political party political or class.
As these public service providers can be embarrassed by a different class, political parties, civil society and other people who are likely to be involved in the public, it may seem to be unexpectedly.
According to the effectiveness of government, all people must be served equally and in accordance with the existing government policies and the employee should understand the difference between the responsibilities he or she is prevailing from any government.
Example 1: An employee belongs to anyone who has to compete with some of the public interest groups in one year, he or she is prevailing to his or her supervisor or her supervisor or her official duties to performing to any individual or her ministers to the employee, and submit it to his or her application.
Example 2: Employees are expected to support the ministers or members of the council to make up their portfolios, if the organization of state's political documents are also used by the Minister, such as the debtor's party in a particular party.
An employee hones and defend the position of every person and the rights in terms of the Constitution.
Employees should be behave in a manner to show respect of the public, unambiguous, he or she is expected to understand what his or her standard of Codem Conduct and to assist other employees.
Example 1: If an employee working in the public servant in the public serves as a public servant who is supervised, he or she will also be served by the employee, he or she will also be served to be served by the employee, and that he or she should be served to be served by the best interests of his or her supervisor and should be served by providing the best possible value.
Example 2: People are pushing in unfair conditions for funding to apply for maintenance. Employees who are in favour of the application forms must ensure that the conditions of persons and serve as necessary.
An employee should also consider the right of access to information, excluding information that is not legal protected by law.
The Constitution of the Republic provides two sides when it comes to the promotion of information in the First community, is the matter of transparency, which allows the public to enable citizens to have access to their rights.
As the public servant's public servant is aware of the operation, confirms that any information is the Public Service, is a matter of public servants in the Public Service Act, 1995 is a matter that is administered by the Public Service.
At all times employees should consider the right of citizens to access information.
Every department must establish relevant legislation with national legislation to regulate the matter within their departments.
Employees should also know the status and rules governing affairs in their departments.
Reasons and procedures which are followed in certain performance, must be noted that the information is required.
If a member of the country becomes a member failed to get, the person must be given reasons for the refusal of the information.
Example 1: Providing opportunities for the country's public, it is a very important issue. If a member of the public may request details for further firearms to be provided for before the expiry of this year.
Example 2: For instance, access to information also means that the information should be monitored and a newly. When a member of a parliament request for a debate that is suspended on Parliament, the failure of providing effective information.
